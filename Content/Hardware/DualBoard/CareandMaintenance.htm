            <br />Care and Maintenance</h1>
        <p>This chapter covers basic care and maintenance tips for the DualBoard and pens.</p>
        <p><span class="Bold">DualBoard</span>
        </p>
        <p>The DualBoard may be used as a standard whiteboard. Expo dry erase whiteboard pens and cleaner are recommended. Use a soft cloth and gentle cleanser safe for whiteboards to clean the DualBoard.</p>
        <p><span class="Bold">Pens</span>
        </p>
        <p>Pens are automatically charged when they are correctly seated  in the pen charger. The pen charger will beep when the pen is correctly inserted and a yellow light will indicate that the pen is successfully charging.</p>
        <p>If the pen no longer holds a charge, the battery may need replaced. The pen uses one half-cell AAAA NiMH battery. </p>
        <p>To change the battery:</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Depress the small tab and slide the two sections of the digital pen apart.</li>
            <li>Insert the new battery with the positive (+) terminal facing towards the tip of the pen.</li>
            <li>Depress the pen tip. The pen LED will flash four times if the battery was correctly inserted.</li>
            <li>Align the ridges within the rear to the slots in the front section.</li>
            <li>Slide the two sections together until the tab re-engages.</li>
            <li>Charge the pen for 8 to 12 hours.</li>
        </ol>
