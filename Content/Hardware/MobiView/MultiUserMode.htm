        <h2>Multi-User Mode</h2>
        <p>Multi-User Mode allows two or more participants to interact in WorkSpace using a collaborative (shared) or defined (one person per defined area) space. Multiple mobile devices can be displayed on the DualBoard, Touch Board or Touch Board Plus at the same time.</p>
        <p>MobiView is automatically designated as the “presenter” tablet in a multi-device environment, (if there is no other device already set as “presenter”) allowing you to start and stop multi-user mode and to view instant reports if using clickers.</p>
