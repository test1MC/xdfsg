        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>You can create and display a Note relating to the current class session on the Mobi 360 and the Insight 360 Teacher app. Tapping <span class="Italic">Note</span> in the Lesson Zone opens Note View. The Note View contains Pen, Mouse Point and Eraser tools. Options for writing, erasing, deleting and displaying a Note are provided along with color and line width options. Notes are saved only for the duration of the current class and are deleted when the class ends.</p>
        <p>The Note Pen tool works the same as the Lesson Zone’s digital pen. In Note View, you can write directly on the Mobi 360 screen or on the normal writing area to compose Note. </p>
        <p>To access the Note Pen tool, tap <span class="Italic">Note</span> from the Lesson Zone (The Pen tool is selected by default.). Alternatively, Tap Pen from the Note View.</p>
