        <h3 class="task">Deleting Annotations</h3>
        <p>Using the Mobi 360, you can delete (or clear) all annotations currently showing on the classroom computer screen. Deleting annotations permanently removes all writings and drawings generated by the Mobi 360 from the classroom computer screen. To delete just a portion of the screen, use the digital pen with the Eraser tool.</p>
