        <p>Use Multi-user mode to simultaneously display input from more than one Mobi family device on the screen.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>In the <span class="Italic">Lesson Zone</span>, tap <span class="Bold">Multi-User</span>. </li>
            <li>Tap one of the following:<ul><li><span class="Bold">Shared</span> - all users share the same screen space</li><li><span class="Bold">2-way</span> - two users, each on their own half of the screen</li><li><span class="Bold">4-way</span> - four users, each on their own quadrant</li></ul></li>
            <li>To keep the background constant while in Multi-user mode, tap <span class="Bold">Use Fixed Background</span>.<div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>If <span class="Italic">Use Fixed Background</span> is selected, the computer desktop will not be available until Multi-user mode is closed. Screen division lines do not show on the fixed background.</p></div></li>
            <li>Tap <span class="Bold">Start</span>.</li>
            <li>While in Multi-user mode, you have access to all of the tools in the Lesson Zone. However, connected student devices can only use pen, eraser and delete all tools.<div class="ImageFloatLeft"><p><img src="../../../Graphics/Mobi360/StudentTools.png" class="SmallHigh192px" /></p></div></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Student tools show in a toolbox in a corner of the screen assigned to the learner device.</li>
            <li>By default, student devices are connected with the pen tool selected.</li>
            <li>Students can change pen color or eraser size by tapping and holding the corresponding icon in the toolbox, then tapping the option in the expanded toolbox.</li>
            <li>Each student can delete everything drawn from his own student device by tapping Delete All.</li>
            <li>If a student is using a Mobi 360 as a learner device, the Hide/Show and Lock/Unlock icons will show in the Mobi 360 digital screen. These icons are indicators of the student device’s status; the student cannot use these to hide/show the annotations or lock/unlock the device.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="Gotham" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Multi-user mode is closed, the Mobi 360 saves the current background for later Multi-user sessions within the same class session.</li>
