        <h3 class="task">Accessing Screenshots from Insight 360</h3>
        <p>Insight 360 stores screenshots captured by the Mobi 360 in a folder on the classroom computer’s hard drive.</p>
        <p>Once a session is ended, you can no longer view the screenshots from the Mobi 360. However, you can view screenshots for a session through the Session Content Report in Insight 360.</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>All favorites, classes, student data, tests, screenshots and other Insight 360 information reside on the classroom computer used to set up this data. It will not be accessible if you take the Mobi 360 to another classroom even if that classroom computer is running Insight 360, unless you have also set up that computer with the same classes, students, favorites and other data.</p>
