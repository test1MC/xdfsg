        <h2 class="task">Asking ExamView Questions</h2>
        <p>You can use the Mobi 360 to ask an individual ExamView questions during instruction.</p>
        <p>The entire ExamView file will open. If the question you want to ask is not at the beginning of the file, use the Scroll Left and Scroll Right buttons on the Mobi 360 to navigate to the applicable question.</p>
        <p>If the ExamView test file contains questions that are not supported by the student response system (such as Short Answer for Spark 360 or Essay for Pulse 360/Spark 360), the Start button will not be enabled on those questions. However, you can still use the material as background to ask a Verbal question instead.</p>
        <p>If an ExamView question has been authored as a dynamic question, you can use the Recalc button to present the question with new variables and new answer options.</p>
