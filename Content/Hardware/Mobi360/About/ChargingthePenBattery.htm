        <h3 class="task">Charging the Mobi 360 Pen Battery</h3>
        <p>The Mobi 360 digital pen is delivered with a partial charge to allow you to start using it directly after unpacking the system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The digital pen charges whenever it is securely placed in its holder in the back of the Mobi 360</li>
            <li>Store the pen in its holder when the pen is not in use</li>
            <li>When the digital pen is in its holder on the Mobi 360, the pen charging icon appears</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may also see other icons associated with the pen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> A charging icon <img src="../../../Graphics/Mobi360/ChargingIcon.png" class="Inline30px" /> appears when the Mobi 360 is charging</li>
            <li> Pen detected <img src="../../../Graphics/Mobi360/PenDetectedIcon.png" class="Inline30px" /> (appears when pen tip is near the Mobi 360 writing surface) </li>
            <li>Pen battery low <img src="../../../Graphics/Mobi360/PenBatteryLowIcon.png" class="Inline30px" /> (needs charging)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>To conserve battery life, the pen goes into “sleep” mode after two minutes of inactivity. Click the rocker button or touch the tip to reactivate the pen.</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Insert the pen into the pen holder at the top of the Mobi 360.</li>
            <li>Press the pen firmly into the holder to ensure a good connection with the recharger.</li>
            <li>Store the pen in the pen holder when the pen is not in use.</li>
            <li>Allow eight hours for the pen battery to fully charge.</li>
