        <h3 class="task">Replacing the Mobi 360 Pen Battery</h3>
        <p>The pen uses a AAAA rechargeable battery that typically lasts more than a year with normal use. Replace the battery when the Mobi 360 digital pen battery will no longer hold a charge.</p>
        <div class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #904799;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;TIP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>To extend the life of the battery, remove the battery from the pen when the pen will not be used for an extended period of time (for example, during summer holiday).</p>

            <li>Insert a new AAAA rechargeable battery with the positive terminal (+) facing toward the tip of the pen.</li>
            <li>Press the pen tip. <p>The LED located at the pen tip will flash four times if the battery was inserted correctly. </p><p>If the LED does not flash four times, remove the battery, check that the battery's positive (+) end is facing toward the tip of the pen, and re-insert the battery.</p></li>
            <li>Align the ridges of the pen's back section with the slots of the pen's front section and slide the two sections together until the tab re-engages.</li>
            <li>Charge the pen battery for eight hours.</li>
