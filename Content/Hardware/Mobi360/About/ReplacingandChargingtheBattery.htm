        <p>The Mobi 360 contains a rechargeable battery pack that can last for several days, with normal use, before requiring charging.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mobi 360 is delivered with a partial charge to allow you to start using it directly after unpacking the system</li>
            <li>The battery must be charged periodically to ensure the Mobi 360 is available for use when you need it</li>
            <li>Allow eight hours to fully charge the Mobi 360 battery</li>
            <li>The digital pen is charged from the Mobi 360 battery when the pen is fully seated in its Mobi 360 holder</li>
            <li>When not being used, the Mobi 360 should remain on its charging stand to ensure it receives a full charge</li>
            <li>The charging stand must be plugged into an electrical outlet using the standard electrical plug for your country</li>
        </ul>
