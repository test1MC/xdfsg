        <p MadCap:conditions="DocType.UG">The Mobi 360 connects with the Insight 360 software through the wireless Mobi 360 receiver. The receiver is a USB device stored in the charging stand or on the backside of the Mobi 360.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="DocType.UG">The Mobi 360 is paired with its Mobi 360 receiver at the factory. This pairing is confirmed the first time the Mobi 360 is turned on. The first time the Mobi 360 is turned on, it attempts to connect automatically with its receiver. If Mobi 360 cannot connect to its receiver, you can manually pair the device.</p>
