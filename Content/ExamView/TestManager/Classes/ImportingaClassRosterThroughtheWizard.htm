        <p>The Import Class Roster Wizard is a three-step process that allows advanced import mapping of a text file to the Test Manager's Student Information.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Step 1:<p><img src="../../../Graphics/EV/TM/Windows/Window-ClassRosterWizardStep1.png" class="Thumbnail" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 1" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 1" MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML" /></p><div class="ImageFloatRight"><p><img src="../../../Graphics/EV/TM/Windows/Window-ClassRosterWizardStep1.png" class="MediumWide288pxGrayBorder" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 1" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 1" MadCap:conditions="DocType.UG" /></p></div><ol><li>Set the row number to start importing student roster records.<ul><li>Use the Preview window to view the first 10 rows of the text file. The row numbers are included in the preview.</li><li>Many text rosters contain header information, a row of labels for each data column. Do not import the header row.</li><li>If the desired import starting point is more than 10 rows into file, it is recommended that you delete the unnecessary rows from the file prior to import.</li></ul></li><li>Indicate how the student names are formatted in the text file by selecting the appropriate radio button.</li><li>Click Next.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Step 2:<p><img src="../../../Graphics/EV/TM/Windows/Window-ClassRosterWizardStep2.png" class="Thumbnail" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 2" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 2" MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML" /></p><div class="ImageFloatRight" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 2" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 2"><p><img src="../../../Graphics/EV/TM/Windows/Window-ClassRosterWizardStep2.png" class="MediumWide288pxGrayBorder" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 2" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 2" MadCap:conditions="DocType.UG" /></p></div><ol><li>Drag the names of field that you want to import from the text file to the target boxes next to the corresponding Test Manager field name. Field names not dragged into a target box will not be imported.<ul><li>Student name and Student ID fields are required for import, all other fields are optional.</li><li>Student IDs must be unique for the record to successfully import. If a duplicate ID is found in the existing class or within the text file, that record will not be imported. A status message at the end of the import process will report if any records were skipped and how many were skipped.</li><li>Field names can be dragged to more than one target box. For example, the student's last name can be mapped to both Last Name and Password.</li></ul></li><li>Use the arrow buttons to advance or reverse the contents being previewed.<p class="InList">The preview is updated in both the Source Text Fields list and in the import target boxes. This is a useful tool for verifying that the desired import data is mapped to the proper Test Manager category.</p></li><li>Click Next.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Step 3:<p><img src="../../../Graphics/EV/TM/Windows/Window-ClassRosterWizardStep3.png" class="Thumbnail" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 3" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 3" MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML" /></p><div class="ImageFloatRight" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 3" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 3"><p><img src="../../../Graphics/EV/TM/Windows/Window-ClassRosterWizardStep3.png" class="MediumWide288pxGrayBorder" title="Class Roster Wizard Step 3" alt="Class Roster Wizard Step 3" MadCap:conditions="DocType.UG" /></p></div><ol><li>Value restricted fields correspond to check boxes in the Student Information dialog and require additional text mapping to indicate which check box should be selected. Value restricted fields flagged for import will display either a check mark or warning icon next to their name. To ensure successful import of all the desired data, advanced field mapping should be performed until no warning icons are displayed. Click Edit Mapping to perform this step.<ul><li>Value restricted fields not flagged for import will have the Edit Mapping button disabled.</li><li>You may continue with the import process and ignore the warnings, but values that are not mapped to a check box will be ignored when imported.</li></ul></li><li>If flagged for import, select the format for the date of birth data using the drop-down list.<ul><li>Only digits can be used to indicate month (M), day (D), and year (Y) values. So dates cannot use strings such as "August" or "Aug." for the month.</li><li>Digits can be contiguous (e.g. MMDDYYYY) or separated by slashes (e.g. MM/DD/YYYY), dashes (e.g. MM-DD-YYYY) or spaces (e.g. MM DD YYYY).</li><li>Year values can be specified using four digits or just the last two digits.</li></ul></li><li>Click Finish. A message appears asking if you want to save the import definition profile.</li><li>Click Yes to save the import definition profile, click No to continue to import without saving the profile, or click Cancel to return to the wizard.<ul><li>After the import process is complete, a message appears displaying the number of student records successfully added and the number of records that were skipped.</li><li>Much of the student demographic information is presented as a series of check boxes.
These value restricted fields include: Gender, Grade Level, Sociological/Economic,
Race/Ethnicity, and Other. If any of these categories are flagged for import, additional
mapping will need to be performed to associate text terms with each check box.</li></ul></li></ol></li>
