        <ul>
            <li>If students are currently taking a test with the ExamView Test Player, you cannot clear results for that student. Instruct your students to close the ExamView Test Player software. To determine who is taking the test, click File from the menu bar and select Update Online Tests. Highlight the assignment you wish to clear and click Info.</li>
            <li>If a particular test is not showing up on the list when a student logs into the ExamView Test Player, check to be sure that the student is entering the correct student ID. If the student ID is correct, click Assignment from the menu bar and select Edit Assignment Information. Check the dates and times listed on the Access tab.</li>
