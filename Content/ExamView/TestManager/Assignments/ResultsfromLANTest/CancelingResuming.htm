        <h3 class="task">Canceling/Resuming LAN Test</h3>
        <p>After all of your students have taken a LAN test and you have received the results, you might want to cancel the test. When you cancel a LAN test, students will no longer see that test among the list of available tests when they log into the ExamView Test Player.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Assignment</span> from the menu bar and select <span class="Bold">Cancel LAN Test</span>.</li>
            <li>If you cancel a LAN test and then want to activate it again (for example, a new student is added to your class and you want him/her to take the test), click <span class="Bold">Assignment</span> from the menu bar and select <span class="Bold">Resume LAN Test</span>.</li>
            <li>After you cancel or resume a LAN test, be sure to save your class file. This will update the associated LAN test (EOT) files to apply your changes.</li>
