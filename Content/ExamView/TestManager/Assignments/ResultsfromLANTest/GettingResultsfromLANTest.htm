        <h2 class="task">Getting Results from LAN Test</h2>
        <p>After your students take an online test using ExamView Test Player, the next step is to get the results into ExamView Test Manager. When you perform this step, the program reads the results and stores the data in the class record. If your test includes open-ended questions, you need to manually score those questions and assign the point values using the Edit Scores option.</p>

If you create a test with the ExamView Test Generator and choose the Allow access to anyone option, results will not be read by the ExamView Test Manager software.</p></div></li>
