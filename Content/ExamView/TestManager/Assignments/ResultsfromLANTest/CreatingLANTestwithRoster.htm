        <h2 class="task">Create an Online (LAN) Test with a Roster</h2>
        <p>With the ExamView Assessment Suite, you can easily track student test results. When
students take an online test, the program automatically scores the objective questions
and stores the information in a database. Then you can produce a variety of reports and/
or copy the results to your gradebook.
</p>
        <p>To create an online test with a roster, you must first build and publish the online test
using the ExamView Test Generator. Then, you must complete the process by creating
an assignment in the ExamView Test Manager program.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Start ExamView Test Generator and create or open a test.
</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">File</span> from the menu bar, mouse over <span class="Bold">Publish To</span>, and select <span class="Bold">ExamView Test Player on
LAN</span>.
</li>
            <li>Select <span class="Bold">Limit access to students in a particular class</span> and click <span class="Bold">Next</span>.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="Bold">Launch ExamView Test Manager after publishing online test</span> check
box, <span class="Bold">name</span> the test tile, and click <span class="Bold">Save</span> to save the online test.<p class="InList">When you save the online test, the program saves a copy of the test (with an
EOT extension) to the location you specified. Remember that your students
must access that location on the local area network (LAN). If you saved the test
to your hard drive, you must copy the online test (the EOT file, not the TST file)
to your network.</p></li>
            <li>If your test includes links to any multimedia files, you must copy those files manually
to the same location as the online test.</li>
