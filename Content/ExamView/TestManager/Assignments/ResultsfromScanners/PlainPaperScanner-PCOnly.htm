        <h3 class="task">Getting Results from a Plain-Paper Scanner (PC Only)</h3>
        <p>Plain-paper scanning allows you to print bubble forms using an ordinary laser printer,
pre-print assignment and student information on the forms, and scan the results using a
TWAIN-compliant image scanner. Because forms can be printed on-demand on
standard sheets of paper, plain-paper scanning provides great flexibility, convenience,
and cost savings over dedicated OMR scanning. Additionally, the hardware required for
plain-paper scanning can be used for other purposes.</p>
        <p>Plain-paper scanning reads the students’ responses for each question, stores this
information for each student, and automatically calculates their score based on the point
values assigned to the questions.</p>
        <p>Properly installed image scanners that are TWAIN compliant will automatically populate the list of available scanners in the Get Results from Scanner dialog. Some scanners will appear in the list because their TWAIN drivers have been installed on the computer, even if the hardware is no longer connected.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Start ExamView Test Manager and open the class.</li>
            <li>Select (highlight) the <span class="Bold">assignment</span> to be scored.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../../../Graphics/EV/TM/Icons/Icon-GetResultsFromScanner.png" title="Get Results from Scanner" alt="Get Results from Scanner" class="Inline30px" />, or click <span class="Bold">Assignment</span> from the menu bar and select <span class="Bold">Get
Results from Scanner</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the desired <span class="Bold">scanner</span> from the drop-down list.<p class="InList">A separate entry will appear for every imaging device with TWAIN drivers installed on the computer. Some scanner manufacturers will install multiple drivers for a scanner, so multiple entries will appear in the list for a single scanner. Try to select the entry for the scanner that is most appropriate for the model and connection of your scanner. Refer to the Troubleshooting section for additional details.</p><div class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #904799;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;TIP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>With plain-paper scanning, there is no need to specify a form and an assignment does not have to be answered using the same form for all students. For example, you can administer a 50 question multiple choice test with most of the class using form ei50AE, but give students with special needs form ei50AE Jr. There is no need to sort the forms or specify which forms are being used. The form information is automatically read in from each sheet as it is scanned.</p></div></li>
            <li>Set the beginning question number and click <span class="Bold">Next</span>.<div class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #904799;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;TIP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>To save paper, you can use the same forms for several assignments. For example, you can administer and scan a quiz with 10 questions. For the next quiz, set the beginning question number to 11 and have your students fill in the bubbles for questions 11-20.</p></div></li>
            <li>Load the forms into the scanner ADF tray or flatbed.<p class="InList">Forms may be rotated 180° from each other but must be placed with the image sides properly facing the scanning surface. Verify that the orientation of the image face of the forms matches the direction specified by the scanner manufacturer.</p></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Start Scanning</span> to initiate scanning.</li>
            <li>Scan the forms.<p class="InList">If the student ID on the form does not match an ID in your class roster, the program gives you the option to select the student from your roster.</p></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Finish</span> to accept the scores and return to the gradebook.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Verify that the scanner is connected properly before you try to scan the forms. If you have trouble with the scanner, view the Troubleshooting section of this help file. If you are still having problems, contact the scanner manufacturer for support.</li>
                    <li>If you have more questions than can be accommodated on a form, divide the test into two parts and create separate assignments.</li>
                    <li>Place the objective questions at the beginning of the test and number the questions consecutively (e.g., multiple choice 1-25, true/false 26-40, etc.).</li>
                    <li>If you have problem with a form, you can make corrections and then re-scan it. If necessary, you can manually enter the points earned.</li>
                    <li>You can include matching questions on a scanned test, but you are limited to the number of choices available on the selected bubble form. Check the form that you intend to use to be sure that the number of answer choices matches your test questions. Or, you can include matching questions with more choices and score them manually.</li>
                    <li>The software allows you to get results for an assignment from multiple sources. For example, you could administer a paper test to part of the class and an online test to homebound students.</li>
                    <li>You can scan forms in multiple sessions.</li>
                    <li>If there are problems with a student’s form—such as missing responses, multiple responses, answer out of range (e.g., entering an E if only A-D valid)—an asterisk ( * ) will appear next to that student’s name. Click Stop Scanning, highlight the student name, and click Edit. You can change the response for any item. Click Start Scanning to continue.</li>
