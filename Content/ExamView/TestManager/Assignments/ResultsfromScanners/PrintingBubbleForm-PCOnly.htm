        <h3 class="task">Printing a Bubble Form (PC Only)</h3>
        <p>ExamView offers a set of pre-formatted bubble forms that can be printed from either Test Generator or Test Manager. These forms are compatible with Test Manager's plain-paper scanning feature. An advantage of printing the forms from the Test Manager, however, is that you can specify to pre-print assignment data (name, date, and period) and/or student roster information (student name, ID, and pre-bubbled ID).</p>
