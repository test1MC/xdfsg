If necessary, you can manually enter the points earned.</li><li>You can include matching questions on a scanned test, but you are limited to the number of choices available on the selected bubble form. Check the form that you intend to use to be sure that the number of answer choices matches your test questions. Or, you can include matching questions with more choices and score them manually.</li><li>The software allows you to get results for an assignment from multiple sources. For example, you could administer a paper test to part of the class and an online test to homebound students.</li><li>You can scan forms in multiple sessions.</li><li>If there are problems with a student’s form—such as missing responses, multiple responses, answer out of range (e.g., entering an E if only A-D valid)—an asterisk ( * ) appears next to that student’s name.

            <li MadCap:conditions="Versions.ASUG">If the scanner becomes unresponsive, click Stop Scanning, press Reset Options
(located on the scanner), and then click Start Scanning. If that does not solve the
problem, cancel the scanning process. Turn the scanner off; turn the scanner on;
and attempt to scan the forms again.
</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Versions.ASUG">The Apperson scanner prints the percentage score on the scanner form. For tests
with only objective questions all set to 1 point, the score will be correct. If your test
includes open-ended questions, the score printed on the form will not reflect the
open-ended questions. Unfortunately, there is no way to disable printing. However,
you can remove the print cartridges.</li>
