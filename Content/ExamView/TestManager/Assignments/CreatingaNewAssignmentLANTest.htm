                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>It is recommended that you preview the online test to make sure that the test itself and online settings are correct.</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

                <ul>
                    <li>To preview a test with a roster, start the ExamView Test Player and use one of your student’s IDs to access the test. When you finish, go to the ExamView Test Manager. Open the class, select the assignment, and choose Get Results from LAN Test from the Assignment menu. You should see the score for that student. Next, highlight (select) the student record and choose Clear Student Results from the Student menu. Be sure to clear the results for the test you just previewed.</li>
                    <li>Many ExamView question banks contain feedback information. Feedback provides hints or tips for finding the correct answer. See the ExamView Test Generator help file for more information on feedback.</li>
                    <li>The end-of-test report can be a powerful learning tool for students. For example, you could set up the report to display the rationale and reference information for incorrect responses. This would provide each student with a customized report of what they missed, as well as how and where to come up with the correct answer.</li>
                    <li>You may assign the same online test to multiple classes. Simply open another class file and create an assignment. Point to the same online (EOT) test as in step 9 above. You can also copy the assignment from one class to another.</li>
                    <li>If you need to make any changes to the online settings (e.g., change the password, edit the reporting options, change point values, etc.) choose Edit Assignment Information from the Assignment menu.</li>
                    <li>After students have taken the test, use the Get Results command to load the results into the ExamView Test Manager.</li>
                    <li>To grade open-ended questions, use the Edit Scores option.</li>
                    <li>If you notice mistakes in questions (misspelled words, etc.) before students take a test, make your changes to the original test and publish it again. You will need to delete the assignment and then create a new one.</li>
                    <li>If you notice mistakes in questions (misspelled words, etc.) after students take a test, you cannot make changes to the test. However, you can adjust the points earned to adjust students’ scores as needed.</li>
