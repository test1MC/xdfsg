        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.ASUG">After you create the assignment, hand out the paper test and clickers
and start session to get the student results directly into
ExamView Test Manager.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML,DocType.UG">Instantly get student results by using Classroom Performance System (CPS) response clickers to complete ExamView assignments. Test Manager supports getting results from IR and Gen2 RF clickers that are part of numbered sets (K-12), not individual, serial-numbered clickers that require activation (Higher Ed.).</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML,DocType.UG">Clicker IDs must be assigned to students in order to correlate the transmitted data with student records.</p>

If the receiver continues to fail detection, try to reinstall the USB-to-serial driver.

For these modes, the Test Manager gradebook will automatically be hidden when the feedback grid window opens.

A message will appear reminding you to turn off the projector before the gradebook is revealed at the end of the session.</p></div><p class="InList" MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML,DocType.UG">Test Manager supports:</p><ul><li><MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead><span class="Bold">Student-Managed</span></MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody> - In this type of session students work at their own pace.
