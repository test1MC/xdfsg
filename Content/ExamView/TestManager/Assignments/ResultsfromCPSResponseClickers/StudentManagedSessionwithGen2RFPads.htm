        <h3>Student-Managed Session with Gen2 RF Pads</h3>
        <p>Student-Managed RF sessions allow students to work at their own pace. Unlike Student-Managed IR or Teacher-Led Student Managed sessions, these sessions do not require a projector to display a feedback grid. Students use the pad LCD to track which question they are on and when a response has been received.</p>
        <div class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #31b24a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ">
            <p>
                <img src="../../../../Graphics/EV/TM/sample001.png" class="SmallWide192px" title="CPS Screen" alt="CPS Screen" />
            </p>
            <p>In this example, pad ID 3 (0003) is ready to answer question 1 (Q:1).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Because answers may include multiple characters, students must press the Send button at the end of every response to signify that the answer is complete. Questions that have been sent display a RECV'D message on the LCD. </p>
        <div class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #31b24a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ">
            <p>
                <img src="../../../../Graphics/EV/TM/sample002.png" class="SmallWide192px" title="CPS Received Screen" alt="CPS Received Screen" />
            </p>
            <p>On this screen, notice that the student's answer (A) and confirmation of sending the response (RECV'D) are displayed for answered questions (Q:1).</p>
        </div>
        <p>While students use their pad LCD to track their individual progress, instructors monitor the class progress through the <span class="Italic">Get Results from Clickers</span> session dialog. The session dialog is not projected and shows the student results in real-time as they are transmitted to the receiver. Scores are shown in either points or percentages, depending on the display setting for the main gradebook.</p>
        <p>If a student believes they have finished the assignment but the session dialog shows that they did not attempt some of the questions, verify that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All questions display the RECV'D message on the pad's LCD screen. It is common that students will forget to press the Send button and use the arrow button to navigate to the next question without submitting their answer. Simply use the arrows to quickly scroll through the questions, verify that all have been sent, and press the Send button for any question that was missed.</li>
            <li>The RECV'D message does not discriminate between valid and out of range responses whereas Test Manager does not accept invalid answers. It is possible, therefore, for a question to appear to have been sent on the pad LCD, but show up as unanswered on the session dialog. <div class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #31b24a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "><p>If a student accidentally sends "AB" for a multiple choice answer or "F" when there are only choices A-E. Have the student verify that all the answers are valid and in-range for the question. Press the Clear button to remove any invalid input and resend.</p></div></li>
        </ul>
