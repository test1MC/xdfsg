        <h1>Score Paper Tests with Clickers</h1>
        <p>Using ExamView Test Manager, you can easily administer paper tests and score them
with clickers.
</p>
        <p>When you use clickers to score your students’ tests, you engage students with
technology, and get instant, real-time results.
</p>
        <p>Similar to scanning results, clicker technology makes it easy to
automatically grade most objective questions (e.g., multiple choice, yes/no, and true/
false). If a test includes both objective and open-ended questions, you can score the
objective questions with the student response devices and then manually grade and
record the points for the open-ended questions later. Using clickers
has the added advantage of engaging students with technology. Entering and
transmitting answers with clickers is fun and easy!</p>

        <p>Test Manager supports using CPS clickers to
transmit student results directly into the gradebook.
Supported clickers include ResponseCard NXT, QT, CPS Spark, CPS
Pulse, CPS IR (infrared), Gen2 RF (radio frequency)
and vClicker. Currently, only numbered sets of devices
(K-12) can be used with ExamView. Individual, serial
numbered devices (Higher Ed.) are not supported at
this time.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">About Device Manager</p>
        <p>ExamView now can utilize Device Manager to configure and control the Student Response Systems (radio frequency or infrared hubs and their receivers).</p>
        <p>Device Manager can be accessed from the notification area, and can be used to set the receiver channel, turn off all the clickers at once, and test the connection. </p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">About the IR System</p>
        <p>Each IR receiver unit supports up to 60 clickers and under optimal conditions can accept signals up to 60 feet away. Students must have a direct line-of-sight to successfully transmit to the receiver and when under heavy use, may experience signal interference that requires re-sending their response.</p>
        <p>Students transmit their responses by simply pressing a button on the clicker. A feedback grid should be projected to the class to allow students to verify that their results have been successfully received.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">About the Gen2 RF System</p>
        <p>Each RF receiver unit supports up to 300 clickers in K-12 mode and has a range of 200 feet. Unlike the IR system, RF clickers are not limited to line-of-sight transmission. Because of its large range, it is important that each classroom use a different channel number to prevent communication problems. Clickers and receivers are programmed  to a specific channel number and care should be taken not to mix the clickers from different sets. The channel number is displayed on the receiver in bright red when powered by a USB connection. Access the summary screen to display the channel number programmed for the clicker.</p>

        <p>This is clicker ID 3 (0003), programmed for channel number 15 (CH:15). Notice that the lower right of the screen must show K12 not HE to work with Test Manager.</p>
        <p>Students may enter responses up to 12 characters in length which include letters A-J, numbers, and symbols (+, -,*, /, X, Y, parentheses, decimal, space). Because of its multi-character support, students must press the Send button on the clicker when they are ready to transmit their answer. It is important that students verify that all of their answers have been received. In Teacher-Led Student-Managed sessions (TLSMA), the projected feedback grid changes color when responses are received. For Student-Managed sessions (SMA), the clicker's LCD screen displays a RECV'D message.</p>
