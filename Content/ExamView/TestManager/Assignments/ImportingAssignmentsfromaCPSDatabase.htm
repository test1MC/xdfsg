        <h2 class="task">Importing Assignments from a CPS Database</h2>
        <p>Importing assignments from CPS brings in data that includes student responses, points earned, correct answers, difficulty level, and standards associated with the questions in the CPS session data. Even if the CPS session data is collected from an ExamView source, imported questions cannot be viewed from within Test Manager. Aside from this limitation, imported assignments appear identical to ExamView-created assignments and can be analyzed using Test Manager's reporting tools.</p>

            <p>Student records are matched to the Test Manager roster based on student ID alone. First name, last name, and device IDs are not compared.</p>
