        <p MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML,DocType.UG">When you create an assignment, you can choose to administer a test as both a paper test and an online test. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.ASUG">Before you can score a test, you must first build it using ExamView Test Generator and
then create an assignment in ExamView Test Manager. When you create the
assignment, ExamView Test Manager automatically opens the test file and reads
the following information for each question (if available): answer, reference, learning
objective, local standard, state standard, national standard, and points.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Use ExamView Test Generator to build a test<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="DocType.HTML,DocType.UG"> and print copies for each student</MadCap:conditionalText>.<p MadCap:conditions="Versions.ASUG">Automated scoring methods such as scanning or response
device transmission only work with objective questions such as
multiple choice and true/false. If your test includes open-ended
questions such as short answer or essay, you must manually
score those questions and record the points.</p><div class="Note" MadCap:conditions="Versions.ASUG" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>If you plan to administer multiple (scrambled) versions of a test, create one
version, print it, and then save the file. Scramble the test to create the next
version, print it, and save the test. For each unique test, you must create a
separate assignment.</p></div></li>
            <li>Open ExamView Test Manager and open your class.<div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>A single class may contain up to 200 assignments.</p></div></li>

                <p>You may assign the same paper test to multiple classes. Simply open another class file and create an assignment. Point to the same test as in step 9 above. You can also copy the assignment from one class to another.</p>
                <p>If you need to make any changes to the settings (e.g., change the assignment name, change point values, etc.) click Assignment from the menu bar and select Edit Assignment Information.</p>
                <p>If students take the test on scan forms or with clickers, use the Get Results command to load the results into the ExamView Test Manager. If students take the test on paper, use the Edit Scores command to enter their scores.</p>
                <p>If you are using a scanner or clicker, your test can include open-ended questions such as short answer or essay. However, you will have to manually score those questions and record the points. If your test includes both objective and open-ended questions, place the objective questions (e.g., multiple choice) at the beginning of the test.</p>
                <p>If you created multiple versions of the same test, save each version of the test as a separate test (TST) file. Then create two separate assignments (one for each version of the test) in ExamView Test Manager. When you scan, transmit, or enter the test results into Test Manager, some of the students will not have a score for assignments (depending on which version of the test they took). These blank scores will not be used when calculating averages on reports.</p>
