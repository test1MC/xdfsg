        <h2 class="task">Updating Online Tests</h2>
        <p>Information is often sent from ExamView Test Manager to your LAN-based test (EOT) files. For example, when you change the preferences for an assignment, such as whether or not students can check their answers, or when you add a student to your roster, Test Manager sends that information to your test files.</p>
        <p>The process of communicating this information happens automatically whenever you save your class file. However, you may also choose to send updated information to your test files at any time by using the Update Online Tests command.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">File</span> and select <span class="Bold">Update Online Tests</span>.<p class="InList">A list of the active LAN test assignments appears. For each assignment, the test file name and status appear. The status indicates whether the test file is currently in-sync with Test Manager or if information needs to be communicated.</p><p class="InList">The status of an assignment may be any of the following:</p><ul><li><span class="Bold">OK</span> - Everything is up to date.</li><li><span class="Bold">needs update</span> - The information in the online (EOT) test file does not match the information in Test Manager. For example, the assignment settings have been changed, students have been added to the roster, or the results have been cleared since the last time the class file was saved.</li><li><span class="Bold">missing assignment</span> - The online test file was found, but the assignment does not exist in the file.</li><li><span class="Bold">file not found</span> - The online test file cannot be found. It has been moved or deleted.</li><li><span class="Bold">file in use</span> - The online test file is currently being used. A student may be taking the test.</li></ul></li>
            <li>If any files are in use, highlight the file and click <span class="Bold">Info</span> to see which student or students are currently accessing the test. If you want to update this test, you will need to have these students quit accessing the test.</li>
            <li>Any files that have a status of <span class="Italic">needs update</span>, <span class="Italic">missing assignment</span>, or <span class="Italic">file not found</span> will have a check mark next to them. Click <span class="Bold">Update</span> to update these files. For any files with a status of <span class="Italic">file not found</span>, you will be given the opportunity to locate the online test file.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Done</span> when you are finished updating online tests.</li>
