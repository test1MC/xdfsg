        <h2 class="task">Creating/Managing Custom Filters</h2>
        <p>Creating custom filters allows you to print reports for only those students who meet a set of predefined selection criteria.</p>
        <p>When you apply a filter to a report, the class averages (and other cumulative averages and calculations) are based on the population that matches the filter. For example, suppose you have a class of 99 students with 33 students in three different periods (defined using the custom field). When you print a report for students in Period 1, the class averages, shaded graph area, etc. will be based on those 33 students in Period 1 (not the entire 99 students).</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>From the Manage Custom Filters dialog, highlight the filter you wish to edit and click <b>Edit</b> or click <b>New</b> to create a new filter.<div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>To delete an existing filter, highlight the filter you wish to delete and click Delete.</p></div></li>
            <li>Enter or edit the name for your filter (e.g., 4th graders).</li>
            <li>Set up your selection criteria (e.g., Grade Level = 4).</li>
            <li>If you wish to include multiple criteria in your filter, click <span class="Bold">More</span> and set up another set of criteria. Select <span class="Bold">and</span> if you want to list students who meet both sets criteria. Select <span class="Bold">or</span> if you want to list students who fit either set of criteria.<div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>If you use multiple criteria in a filter, criteria separated by and are grouped together while criteria separated by or are processed separately. </p></div></li>
            <li>Repeat step 4 as necessary. You may include up to five sets of criteria in a single filter. Click <span class="Bold">Fewer</span> to remove criteria from the filter.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to record your changes.<p class="InList">Filters are stored as part of the class file. You can include up to 15 filters per class file.</p></li>
