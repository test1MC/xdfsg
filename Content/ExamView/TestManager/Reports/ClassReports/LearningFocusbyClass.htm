            <p>The Learning Focus report provides a wealth of information to help you identify areas where your class (as a whole) needs to focus their learning efforts. To use this report effectively, the assignments you create must consistently include data for one or more of the following fields: learning objective, local standard, state standard, or national standard.</p>
            <p>

        <p>One of the key advantages of using the ExamView Test Manager is that you can easily gather performance data over multiple assessments. The report shows the number of items for each standard. That way, you can gauge whether a standard was adequately covered. You can select one or more assignments by category or by date. You must also identify a focus range (e.g., 0% - 70%). The program produces a report that shows each standard (or learning objective), the number of questions assessed for that standard, class average, how many students are in the focus range, and how many are proficient.</p>
        <p>In addition, this report provides links to remedial instruction resources. Look for the globe icon to indicate that content hyperlinks are supported.</p>
        <p>Remedial instruction is provided through netTrekker d.i. You must have an active netTrekker d.i. account to access the resources. To learn more about netTrekker, visit <a href="http://www.nettrekker.com/">www.netTrekker.com</a>.</p>

            <p>The shaded area shows the performance for the median 70% of the
students in your class. For example, if there are 20 students in your class, the
top 3 scores (15%) and lowest 3 scores (15%) would not be included. The range
of scores represents 14 students or 70% of the class. The diamond shows
the actual class average. Use the graphs to see how the majority of students
performed. If the area is relatively short, students’ scores were similar.</p>

            <p>Remediation hyperlinks are only available for state standards. The state standard information must include an alignment code in order to link to remedial instruction. The ExamView® Learning Series questions include state standard alignment codes. Learn more at our website <a href="http://www.einstruction.com/">www.einstruction.com</a>.</p>
