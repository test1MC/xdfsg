            <p>The Performance Summary report provides a summary of your class’ performance for all class assignments in a category over a specified date range. The Performance Summary report lists a learning objective/standard, the number of items (i.e., questions) that assess that objective/standard, and the proficiency level that the class as a whole has attained.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>To use the Performance Summary report effectively, you must consistently include question information for one or more of the following fields in each of the items you create: learning objective, local standard, state standard, or national standard. (Many publishers include this information for the questions they provide.)</p>
        <p>You can customize the Performance Summary report to generate the performance data that best meet your needs. You can select the date range for the class assignments, and you can set an appropriate proficiency target (e.g., 70% and above) for the class assignments at a particular time in the term. As an example, you might set the proficiency target at 70% with the first class assignment that covers a particular learning objective/standard. Then, on a subsequent class assignment on the same learning objectives/standards, you might set the proficiency target at 80%.</p>

                    <p>The shaded area shows the performance for the median 70% of the students in your class. For example, if there are 20 students in your class, the top 3 scores (15%) and lowest 3 scores (15%) would not be included. The range of scores represents 14 students or 70% of the class. The diamond shows the actual class average. Use the graphs to see how the majority of students performed. If the area is relatively short, students’ scores were similar.</p>
