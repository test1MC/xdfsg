            <p>The Item Analysis Summary report provides results by type of question and by individual question, the percent of the class that answered each question correctly. For multiple choice questions, the report also shows the percent of the class that selected each response (or answer choice).</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>You can use the response analysis in the Item Analysis Summary to identify areas in which you may want to focus a re-teaching activity so that you can better address particular learning objectives/standards. For questions with a high response analysis, you can validate the question. If a question has a low response analysis, you can assess whether the average points to a problem with the question. For example, suppose students answered a question overwhelmingly (e.g., 60%) with an incorrect response. This may have occurred because you recorded an incorrect answer for the question, the question was unclear, or you did not cover the information adequately in class.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If, in a particular multiple choice question, the student responses are evenly distributed for all of the answer choices, the analysis may indicate that students randomly selected a response. If, in another multiple choice question, students selected the correct response at 65% followed by 30% for the next response, this response analysis data may point to a common mistake students made in determining the correct answer for the question. On a question-by-question basis, you should look for similar patterns; such information can provide insight into your students’ understanding of the material covered by the assignment.</p>

            <li>The answers and student responses for multiple choice and multiple response questions use the A-E choice sequence regardless of how the test was set. This is to avoid confusion if you administer tests using multiple delivery methods and/or deliver scrambled versions of the tests. However, you can set the choice sequence on the Assignment Review and Assignment Results by Student reports.</li>
