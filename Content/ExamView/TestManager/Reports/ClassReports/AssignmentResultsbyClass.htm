        <p>The Assignment Results report provides performance data for each student for a particular assignment. The report includes the student’s name, ID, points earned, and percentage achieved. For online tests, the report also includes attempts to complete the assignment, the start time (date and time), and the duration of the assignment (i.e., the total time to complete the assignment).</p>

        </p>
        <p>The report also includes a separate page with the assignment statistics for the entire class (i.e., median, mean, low score, high score, range, and standard deviation) and a graph of the frequency distribution. When this report is selected, you can control various reporting options. For example, you can choose to show all of the student information or you can include the ID or alias for each student.</p>
        <p>Using the statistical data in the Assignment Results report, you can see how the majority of the students performed on the assignment. The duration data provides useful information for future reference; you can calculate the approximate amount of time required for the students to complete the assignment. Finally, you might use the Assignment Results report to post the results of an assignment.</p>
