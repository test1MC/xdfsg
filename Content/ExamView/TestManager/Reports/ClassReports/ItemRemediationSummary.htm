            <p>The Item Remediation Summary report provides a summary of questions that the class answered incorrectly at a rate higher than the set threshold level. The report pinpoints questions that may require re-teaching. The report also provides links to remedial instruction resources. Look for the globe icon to indicate that content hyperlinks are supported.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Remediation hyperlinks are available for keywords and state standards. The state standard information must include an alignment code in order to link to remedial instruction. The ExamView Learning Series questions include state standard alignment codes.

        <p>You can use the Item Remediation Summary to identify problem areas for your class and locate remedial instruction activities to help with re-teaching. The report shows the questions that fall above your set threshold, the question type, class average, state or learning objective, and hyperlinked keywords and state standards associated with the questions.</p>
        <p>Remedial instruction is provided through netTrekker d.i. You must have an active netTrekker d.i. account to access the resources. To learn more about netTrekker, visit <a href="http://www.nettrekker.com/">www.netTrekker.com</a>.</p>

                    <p>The answers and student responses for multiple choice and multiple response questions use the A-E choice sequence regardless of how the test was set.

However, you can set the choice sequence on the Assignment Review and Assignment Results by Student reports.</p>
