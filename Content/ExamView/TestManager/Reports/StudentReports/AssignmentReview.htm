            <p>The Assignment Review report provides a tool to help your students understand the mistakes they made on an assignment. For each question answered incorrectly, the report shows the following: points earned, student’s response, correct answer, rationale, reference, and focus area (depending on the information available).</p>
            <p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>To use the Assignment Review report effectively, you must consistently include extra question information for each of the items you create. (Many publishers include this information for the questions they provide.) For example, a study tip such as Refer to pp. 23-25 is the information in the Reference field for a question. Students, in this example, could use the report to refer to the specified pages in their textbook as they review the questions that they answered incorrectly.</p>
        <p>Students can use the Assignment Review report to review the completed assignments and to learn from their mistakes.</p>

            <li>If students took the test on a scanner form, select the choice sequence from the scanner form for multiple choice/multiple response questions. Since this report displays the student's response for each question, the choice sequence is necessary to display these in a way that matches the scanner form.</li>
