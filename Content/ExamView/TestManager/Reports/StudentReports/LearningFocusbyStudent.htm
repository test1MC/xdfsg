            <p>The Learning Focus report identifies areas where a student needs to focus his/her learning efforts. Based on a proficiency level you set, the report lists the learning objective/standards that a student has not mastered. For each of the learning objectives/standards the student has not yet mastered, the Learning Focus report lists the learning objective/standard, the associated number of items, the points earned on items, and the proficiency level that the student has attained.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>You can customize the Learning Focus report to generate the performance data that best meet your needs. You can select one or more class assignments by category and the date range for the assignments. You can set an appropriate focus range (e.g., 0% - 70%) for the class assignments at a particular time in the term. As an example, you might set the focus range at 0% to 70% with the first class assignment that covers a particular learning objective/standard. Then, on a subsequent class assignment on the same learning objectives/standards, you might set the focus range to 0% to 80%.</p>
        <p>You can use the Learning Focus report to help a student know exactly what to study in order to attain mastery level on the identified learning objectives/standards.</p>

            <p>The shaded area shows the performance for the median 70% of the
students in a class. For example, if there are 20 students in a class, the top 3
scores (15%) and lowest 3 scores (15%) would not be included. The range of
scores for 14 students (70%) would be represented. The diamond shows
your student’s actual performance. Use the graphs to see how a student
performed in relation to his/her class. For example, if the diamond appears near
or past the right edge of the shaded area, the student’s performance is in the
upper range for the class. If the shaded area is relatively short, students’ scores
were similar.</p>
