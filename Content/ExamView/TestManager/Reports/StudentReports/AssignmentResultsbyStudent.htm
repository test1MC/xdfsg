            <p>The Assignment Results report reflects a student’s performance for one assignment. The report includes the following information: assignment average, points earned for each question, and the student’s response for each question. An <span class="Italic">X</span> appears next to each question that the student answered incorrectly. A hyphen appears next to each question for which the student earned partial credit.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>If you select the option for performance results for learning objectives/standards, the Assignment Results report also includes each learning objective and the following performance data for that learning objective/standard: the average, points earned, the proficiency level, and the specific questions in the class assignment. To use the Assignment Results report effectively, you must consistently include question information for one or more of the following fields in each of the items you create: learning objective, local standard, state standard, or national standard. (Many publishers include this information for the questions they provide.)</p>
        <p>You can use this report to identify each student’s proficiency level for each of the learning objectives/standards for each assignment. This information may also help you to identify areas in which a student may need remedial work.</p>

            <li>Select which focus area (learning objective, national standard, state standard, local standard) to include on the report. The available choices will depend on the information available in the selected assignment.</li>
            <li>If students took the test on a scanner form, select the choice sequence from the scanner form for multiple choice/multiple response questions. Since this report displays the student's response for each question, the choice sequence is necessary to display these in a way that matches the scanner form.</li>

                    <p>The shaded area shows the performance for the median 70% of the students in a class. For example, if there are 20 students in a class, the top 3 scores (15%) and lowest 3 scores (15%) would not be included. The range of scores for 14 students (70%) would be represented. The diamond shows your students' actual performance. Use the graphs to see how a student performed in relation to his/her class. For example, if the diamond appears near or past the right edge of the shaded area the students performance is in the upper range for the class. If the shaded area is relatively short, students scores were similar.</p>
