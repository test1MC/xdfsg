        <h2 class="task">Exporting Questions from ExamView</h2>
        <p>Questions may be exported as a Rich Text Format (RTF), HTML, ExamView Question Bank (BNK), ANGEL (ZIP), Blackboard (ZIP) or WebCT (ZIP) file.</p>
        <p>The Rich Text Format (RTF) provides an easy way to export to a program such as a word processor. Depending on the application you use to import an RTF file, some of the formatting options may not be supported. For example, WordPad does not accommodate tables, borders, shading, etc.</p>
        <p>The export option supports both the WebCT and Blackboard (Bb) formats. When you export a test using either of these formats, the program formats the questions and images and then compresses them into one ZIP file that you can import into your course management system. Refer to the topics under the Working with an LMS category for details.</p>
