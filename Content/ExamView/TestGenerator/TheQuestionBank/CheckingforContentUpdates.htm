        <h2 class="task">Checking for Content Updates</h2>
        <p>Publisher-provided question banks and tests are periodically updated to keep state standards and question content current. You can check for content updates as often as you like.</p>
        <div class="Warning" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ee4137;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;WARNING&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>Downloaded content will overwrite your existing question banks, state standards within your question banks, and publisher-created tests (depending on the update type). To avoid losing changes you may have made to your question banks or the publisher test files, it is recommended that you make a backup copy of your existing question banks and publisher tests and save them in a different folder.</p>
        </div>
        <p>An active internet connection is required to download content updates.</p>
