        <h4>Known Issues</h4>
        <p>If you have problems exporting/importing questions, refer to the information below. For the latest information regarding the export utility go to the <span class="Italic">Support</span> area on our website at www.einstruction.com.</p>
        <p>The following information describes situations where content exported from ExamView may be modified to fit the constraints imposed by WebCT CE 6/Vista 4.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Images, including equations and formulas, cannot be displayed in the General Feedback area.</li>
            <li>WebCT CE 6/Vista 4 does not support importing question items without also importing a quiz containing all the questions.</li>
            <li>WebCT CE 6/Vista 4 filters out the symbols "&lt;", "&gt;", and "&amp;" from ExamView test/question bank titles. These symbols can be manually added back to the title from within the WebCT environment.</li>
            <li>WebCT CE 6/Vista 4 does not support the concept of a narrative (a common piece of information shared by multiple questions). During export to WebCT, ExamView copies the content of each narrative to every question that refers to it.</li>
            <li>Although ExamView supports Matching questions that contain just a picture or equation as an answer choice, Matching questions in WebCT CE 6/Vista 4 must contain some text. For choices consisting of just equations/images/graphs, add "Choice A", "Choice B", etc. labels in front of the graphics to distinguish the choices in the answer drop-down menu.</li>
            <li>Matching question scoring in WebCT CE 6/Vista 4 does not support specifying different scores for individual pairs of matches.</li>
            <li>Multiple Response questions with Partial Scoring will automatically be set to allow negative scores when imported into WebCT CE 6/Vista 4. If negative scores are not desired, you will need to manually change this setting for the question.</li>
        </ul>
