        <h2>WebCT</h2>
        <p>Using ExamView you can publish or export tests and question banks to WebCT. Publishing allows you to push content from ExamView directly to the server whereas exporting involves saving a file and uploading it to WebCT through the browser. These two options give you the flexibility to create tests in ExamView and then deliver them online via WebCT. You can also set up your e-learning platform to automatically store the test results into your online gradebook.</p>
        <p>If you have problems exporting/uploading question content from ExamView Test Generator, see the <span class="Italic">Known Issues</span> section for your specific WebCT platform or go to the <span class="Italic">Support</span> area on our website www.eInstruction.com.</p>
        <p>Web services for WebCT publishing were developed using the gSOAP library.</p>
