        <p class="SmallTitle">How to export a test/question bank for WebCT...</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Create or open a test/question bank in ExamView Test Generator.<p class="InList">WebCT does not support all of the ExamView question types. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="WebCTQuestionSupport.htm">WebCT Question Support</MadCap:xref>.</p></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">File</span> from the menu bar, mouse over <span class="Bold">Export</span> and select <span class="Bold">WebCT CE 6/ Vista 4</span>.</li>
            <li>Set the location where you want to save the exported file.</li>
            <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">file name</span> and click <span class="Bold">Save</span>.<p class="InList">The file does is not created and saved until the next step is completed. The file will be saved as a ZIP file.</p></li>
            <li>Complete the export dialog options:<ol><li>Enter a <span class="Bold">category name</span> for the content.<p class="InList">WebCT uses the category name to perform operations on groups of questions (e.g., view all questions in a category, delete all questions in a category, etc.). Choose a category name that will be helpful to you in working with the questions. For example, you could use Chapter 1 for the category name. In turn, you could easily locate questions for a chapter. You could also include a course or book title as part of the category name to further identify the questions.</p></li><li>Select the formatting options. The best option to choose will depend on the type of formatting required by the questions in your test or question bank. The three options are:<ul><li><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/EV/HTML.flsnp" /></li><li><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/EV/HTMLnofonts.flsnp" /> WebCT and/or your browser.</li><li><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/EV/HTMLnoDefaultFonts.flsnp" /></li></ul></li></ol></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to export your test/question bank.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="NextSteps" MadCap:autonum="Next Steps">&#160;</p>
        <p>As part of the export process, ExamView compresses all of the files into one ZIP file. This makes it easier to import the questions into your e-learning platform. The next step is to upload and unzip these questions into the WebCT server.</p>
