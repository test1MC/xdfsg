        <h4>Specific to the Blackboard 6.0 - 7.0 format only:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Blackboard does not support uploading a quiz directly. Instead, you must export a test from ExamView, upload the questions, then reconstruct the quiz on the Blackboard server after importing the questions. Because of this limitation, question points do not get imported to Blackboard.</li>
            <li>Blackboard does not label Multiple Choice answer choices while ExamView uses the letters "a - e." Answers such as "both a and b" will be somewhat unclear when imported into Blackboard.</li>
            <li>Blackboard does not support question information fields (e.g., difficulty code, reference, keywords, etc.) Consequently, ExamView does not export the question information. Although Blackboard does allow quiz questions to be assigned point values, question pool questions do not have point values.</li>
        </ul>
