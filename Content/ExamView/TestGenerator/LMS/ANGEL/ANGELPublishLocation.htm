        <h3>ANGEL Publish Location</h3>
        <p>ExamView publishes the quiz to the <span class="Italic">Lessons</span> section of the ANGEL course. You cannot publish outside of the <span class="Italic">Lessons</span> section, but you can specify publishing to an existing sub-directory within the <span class="Italic">Lessons</span> section.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Italic">Publish Location</span> window shows the current folder structure of the <span class="Italic">Lessons</span> section and the publish location as a file path below. To select a different publish location, highlight the folder name and click OK.</p>
        <p>If you do not see the desired folder destination, verify that the correct course was selected in the <span class="Italic">Publish to ANGEL</span> window. The publish location window only allows you to select a different location, you cannot create a different folder structure from within ExamView.</p>
