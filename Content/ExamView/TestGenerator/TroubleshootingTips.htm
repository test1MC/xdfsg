                        <p>After selecting either the <span class="Italic">QuickTest Wizard</span> or the <span class="Italic">Select Question Bank </span>command, click the Browse (folder) button and identify the folder that contains the question bank files.</p>
                        <p>The question banks for your text should be installed in their own folder inside another folder called banks. Both of these folders are located in the program folder (e.g., c:\examview\banks\science or c:\examview\banks\history). The question bank folder name is usually based on the textbook title, author's name, or subject area. (Question bank files have a BNK extension.)</p>

                    <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                        <p>There are several different versions of the RTF specification. The files exported by ExamView Test Generator are optimized to be imported by Microsoft Word 6.0 (or a more recent version). After you import a file, you can change the format as needed using the features of the host application.</p>

                    <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                        <p>You cannot use the standard Copy/Paste commands to copy the question and answer choices from one multiple choice question and paste them into another multiple choice question. ExamView Test Generator uses a special table format for the choices. This is also true for matching questions. Or, you can use the Duplicate command in the Question menu to make a copy of a matching or multiple choice question.</p>

                        <p>Choose to edit the question. If the ruler is not displayed, turn it on. Then, click in the paragraph you want to check. Look at the ruler to see if there are any extra tab characters or the indent is set improperly. Make adjustments to the ruler layout as needed.</p>

                        <p>If you have a table on the first line of a question, move the insertion point with the arrow keys to the beginning of the first cell in the table. Then, press the ENTER key to insert a blank line before the table.</p>

                        <p>Some printers have a smaller printable area than what is standard. In these cases, the page number may print off the bottom edge of the printable area. You can change the footer (first page and subsequent pages) to adjust for this problem. Choose to edit the footer and then enter a carriage return after the page number placeholder. If this does not work, try two carriage returns after the page number.</p>

                                <p>If you paste text from another application, ExamView Test Generator may use the indent and tab positions from the source copy. If you try to adjust a tab or an indent using the ruler command, you may not be able to set it to the exact position desired since ExamView Test Generator allows you to move tabs/indents in 1/8-inch increments only. If this occurs, use the Tabs and/or Paragraph options to make the necessary adjustments. Using these options, you can change the tab/indent settings in 1/16-inch increments.</p>

                                        <p>Pictures come in many different formats—black and white, 16-colors, 256-colors, and millions of colors. If your monitor is set to display images in 256-colors and you insert a picture with millions of colors, the program may not be able to show the image correctly. For best results and the smallest file sizes, you should use 256-colors images or black and white pictures. If you double-click a picture, the window will show you the format and memory size.</p>

                        <p>ExamView Test Generator does not store the multimedia objects as part of the test file. You must copy these objects to the same folder as the online test or let your students know where they can find these items (e.g., CD-ROM or DVD drive).</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">When you post a test to a server, you must copy the HTM file along with all of the other files in the accompanying file folder (e.g., chapter1.htm and chapter1_files) to your web server. Do not combine the HTM file and its folder in one location. See the sample server folder structure below. All of these files must be in the same relative path on the server as the HTM file. Also, make sure that you did not change the case of the file names for the JPG and GIF files. By default, the test/study guide is looking for these files as lowercase file names. For some operating systems this is not important, but for others it can cause problems. Make sure that your students did not turn off images in the browser. You must have this feature enabled to properly view an internet test generated by ExamView Test Generator.</p>

                        <p>Students must use a browser with support for cascading style sheets level 1 (CSS1) and JavaScript. However, if you create a question with special formatting (e.g, numerous tab stops, indents, etc.) the browser may not be capable of showing some of these more complicated layouts. For example, you should use a table instead of tabs since CSS1 does not support tab positioning.</p>
