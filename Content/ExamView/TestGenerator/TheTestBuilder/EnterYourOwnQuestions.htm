        <h1>Enter Your Own Questions</h1>
        <p>When you build a test using ExamView Test Generator, you select questions from question banks. A question bank (or bank) is a collection of questions
and all of the related items (images, equations, learning objectives, standards, etc.)
stored in one file. Each question bank may contain up to 250 questions, but you can
have an unlimited number of banks. Typically, questions are organized into banks by
chapter or lesson.</p>
        <p>Using the ExamView Test Generator, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter new questions or edit existing questions.
</li>
            <li>Copy and paste questions from another source.
</li>
            <li>Using the ExamView Import Utility, import questions from an
RTF file.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f07600;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>You can create a new question or edit a question while building a test.
However, editing a question after it is included on a test does not change
the original question in the question bank. You must edit or add new
questions in a question bank to make them available as you build tests.</p>
