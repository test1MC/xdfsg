        <h3 class="task">Translating a Test</h3>
        <p>With the translate function, ExamView Test Generator automatically builds a new test using an alternate language question bank. The software does not actually translate a test. It simply finds and selects the matching questions from the alternate question bank(s).</p>
        <div class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f07600;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>The Translate Test command appears in the menu only if the publisher-prepared banks include banks for multiple languages (e.g., English and Spanish).</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Save the current test.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Test</span> from the menu bar and select <span class="Bold">Translate Test to (language)</span>.</li>
            <li>If necessary, you may have to identify the location of the question bank file(s).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>For best results, do not edit any questions or add new ones to the publisher-supplied question banks. If, for example, you edit a question in an English question bank, the equivalent question in the Spanish bank is not updated. This same rule applies for new questions you add to a question bank.</li>
                    <li>Any changes you make to questions on a test or new questions you add will not be reflected in a “translated” test. If you edit a question on a test, it is necessary to make the same edits once the “translated” test appears.</li>
                    <li>If you want to add your own questions, create a completely new question bank. When you create a test that includes your own questions, the program will not be able to “translate” those questions. ExamView Test Generator will display a message letting you know if it could not “translate” some of the questions. You can then manually add those questions to the test.</li>
                    <li>If you accidentally change a question bank, it may be best to re-install the question bank(s). You may need to delete any question bank files you changed for the installer to correctly update the question bank files.</li>
                    <li>Once installed, do not change the folder names for the question banks as the program may not be able to locate the alternate language files.</li>
                </ul>
