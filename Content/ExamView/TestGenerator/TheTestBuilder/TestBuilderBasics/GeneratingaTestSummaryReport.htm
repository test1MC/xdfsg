        <h3 class="task">Generating a Test Summary Report</h3>
        <p>The Test Summary Report displays information about the questions included on the test and may provide links for relevant remediation content. Look for the globe with the orange arrow in the table header to indicate that remedial content links will be active if the question information is available.</p>
        <p>In the first section of the report, a table shows which question banks you selected questions from and their point values. The second section of the report shows the number of questions for each question type. The third section of the report lists the Learning Objectives for the questions (if available) along with the associated keywords. Keywords may contain hyperlinks to remediation content. The last section of the report shows the State Standards (if available) used in the test. State Standards will hyperlink to remediation content if they contain an alignment code.</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>Remediation hyperlinks are only available for keywords and state standards. The state standard information must include an alignment code in order to link to remedial instruction. The ExamView® Learning Series questions include state standard alignment codes.
