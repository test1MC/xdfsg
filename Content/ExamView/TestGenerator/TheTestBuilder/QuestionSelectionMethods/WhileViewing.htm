        <h3 class="task">Selecting Questions While Viewing</h3>
        <p>The Select Questions While Viewing command lets you view the questions on the screen and choose which ones you want to include on a test. It's an easy way to preview questions before you add them to a test. You can see the question and answer together, along with the question information (if available). You may also use the Options button to customize which question information fields are shown in the preview.</p>
