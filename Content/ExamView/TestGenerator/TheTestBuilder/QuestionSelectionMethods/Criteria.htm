        <h3 class="task">Selecting Questions by Criteria</h3>
        <p>When you want to choose questions based on certain criteria, use the Select Questions by Criteria command. You could, for example, select all multiple choice questions that have “average” as the difficulty code. Just enter the search criteria and ExamView Test Generator tells you how many questions match that request. Then select the number of questions you want to include on the test.</p>

            <li>Click <img src="../../../../Graphics/EV/TG/Icons/Icon-SelectbyCriteria.png" title="Select by Criteria Icon" alt="Select by Criteria Icon" class="Inline30px" /> or click <span class="Bold">Select</span> from the menu bar and select <span class="Bold">By Criteria</span>.</li>

            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Next</span>.</li>
            <li>Select a search option. You may choose to have your criteria match exactly or to search using wild cards. If you choose to use wild cards, see the notes below for search commands.<MadCap:dropDown><MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownHotspot>You may use the following commands to refine your search. </MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownBody><p class="InList">Searches are not case-sensitive, so whether or not you use capital letters, your results will be the same.</p><ul><li>To find items where two or more words are all present, just enter the words with a space between them. For example, a search for nouns proper capital would return items with all three words in any order.</li><li>To find items containing certain words in a particular order, place quotation marks around the group of words. For example, a search for "Romeo and Juliet" would return items containing Romeo and Juliet, but not those just containing Romeo, and, or Juliet.</li><li>To find items that don't contain a certain word, place a minus sign immediately before the word to be excluded (no space). For example, a search for subjects predicates -compound would return items containing the words subjects and predicates but not containing the word compound.</li><li>To find items where one word or another is present, enter words in parentheses separated by commas. For example, a search for (adjectives, adverbs) would return items that contain either the word adjectives or the word adverbs.</li><li>To find items that contain words starting with a particular sequence of letters, enter the letter sequence followed by an asterisk. For example, a search for pro* would return words starting with pro, such as pronoun, proper, properties, etc. The asterisk must be at the end of the sequence of letters.</li><li>You may combine the above find commands. For example, a search for noun (common, compound, -proper) would return items that contain the word noun and either common, compound, or not the word proper. A search for -pro* would return all items that did not contain a word beginning with pro.</li></ul></MadCap:dropDownBody></MadCap:dropDown></li>
            <li>Set the <span class="Bold">Question type</span> to filter the search or leave it set to <span class="Bold">Any</span>.</li>

If you select from a list, the <span class="Italic">Search options</span> drop-down menu will automatically be set to <span class="Italic">Match criteria exactly</span>.<p class="InList">After you enter the search criteria, the program shows you how many questions match the criteria from those available (not already selected) in the current bank.</p></li>
            <li>From the pool of questions matching the criteria, you can now select questions individually from a preview window (<span class="Bold">Select While Viewing</span>) or specify the number of questions and have the program randomly choose the questions (<span class="Bold">Select Randomly</span>). Click the button with the desired selection mode.</li>
            <li>From the next dialog, select <span class="Bold">individual questions</span> (Select While Viewing) or <span class="Bold">specify the number of questions </span>(Select Randomly) to add to the test and click <span class="Bold">OK</span>.<p class="InList">The program rebuilds the test in the background to include the selected questions.</p></li>
            <li>Repeat Steps 3-7 to select additional questions.</li>
