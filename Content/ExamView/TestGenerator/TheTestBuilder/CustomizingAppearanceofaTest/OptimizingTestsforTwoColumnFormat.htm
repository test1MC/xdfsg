        <h3 class="task">Optimizing Tests for Two-Column Format</h3>
        <p>When two-column formatting is selected, ExamView displays every question possible in two-column format. The program follows a series of rules in deciding if a question can or cannot be displayed in two-column format.</p>
        <ul class="Gotham">
            <li>Question contains an image or table that is too wide to fit within a column.<p class="InList">Images and tables included in a question must be roughly three inches or less in width in order for the question to display in two columns. (The exact width will depend on your page orientation, margin settings, etc.)</p><p class="InList">Solution - If appropriate, resize the image or table to three inches or less in width. If the image or table cannot be resized, the question will have to display in one column.</p></li>
            <li>Question is between two questions that cannot be displayed in two-column format.<p class="InList">If a question is positioned between two questions that cannot be displayed in two-column format (e.g. wide questions), then it will also display in one column.</p><p class="InList">Solution - Click Reorder and reposition the question.</p></li>
            <li>Question contains dynamic content.<p class="InList">The variability of some dynamic content requires that it display in one column.</p><p class="InList">Solution - Consider replacing the question with one that is not dynamic.</p></li>
            <li>Question is set to always display in one-column format.<p class="InList">ExamView provides the option to always display individual questions in one-column format. If a question will not display in two-column format check to see that it is not set to always display in one column.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Double-click the question that will not display in two-column format.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Info</span>.</li>
            <li>Make sure that a checkmark is not included next to <span class="Italic">Always display this question in one column format in two-column tests</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">OK</span>.</li>
        </ol>
