        <h3 class="task">Publishing a LAN-Based (Online) Test Without a Roster</h3>
        <p>Online (LAN) tests may be created with or without a roster. To record student results from a test, you will need to create a test with a roster. If you are creating a study guide and do not want to record student results, you do not need to create a roster.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Create a new test or open an existing test.<p class="InList">An online test can include any of the question types. Many of these question types are automatically scored.</p></li>

            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Next</span>.</li>
            <li>By default, the test title that the student sees when using the Test Player will be the same as the test title of the file. Specify a different test title if desired.</li>
            <li>Optionally, indicate whether a password is required to access the test.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Next</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Bold">question presentation order</span>. <p class="InList">Questions may be displayed in the same order for all students or scrambled for each student.</p></li>
            <li>Specify <span class="Bold">how many questions are presented</span> and if they should be recalculated. <p class="InList">By default, all questions in the test will be presented to the student.</p></li>
            <li>Select <span class="Bold">Calculate new algorithm values for each student </span>if your test contains dynamic questions and you want the values for these questions to be recalculated for each student's test. <p class="InList">This option is not available if the test does not contain dynamic questions.</p></li>

For example, you could set up the report to display the rationale and reference information for incorrect responses. This would provide each student with a customized report of what they missed, and well as how and where to come up with the correct answer.</p></div></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Next</span>.</li>
            <li>Review the test summary and then click <span class="Bold">Save</span>.<p class="InList">Save the test to a location that is easily accessible to the students. For example, make sure that your students have read/write access to the folder if you store the test on a network server. If you do not have a network, you must copy the online test to each workstation. By default, the test will be saved to the Default Online (LAN) Test Path that is set in the <span class="Italic">Preferences</span>.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you save an online test, the program saves a specially formatted copy of the test (using an EOT extension) to the location you specified. If you saved the test to your hard drive, you will need to copy the EOT file to your network. If your test includes links to any multimedia files, you need to copy those files manually to the same location as the online test.</p>
        <p>Preview your online test to make sure that everything is working. If you notice an error, make any changes to the original test and publish it again.</p>
        <p>Students will take the test using the ExamView Test Player software. If you wish to see student results, instruct them to print a post-test report. See the help file that accompanies the <a href="http://help.turningtechnologies.com/ExamView/TestPlayer">ExamView Test Player</a> for more details.</p>
