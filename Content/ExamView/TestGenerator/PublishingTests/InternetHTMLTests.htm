        <h1>Internet (HTML) tests</h1>
        <p>Using ExamView Test Generator, you can publish any test as an HTML document.
You can create a self-grading study guide or a test that will send student
results to you via email. After you publish the test, you must copy the files to your website
so that your students can access the test.
</p>
        <p>Publishing an HTML test is a quick way to create an online test. However, these
disadvantages exist: (1) you must have your own website and know how to upload files;
(2) there are no settings to control when and who may access a test; (3) results are not
stored in a database for access at a later time; and (4) getting results via email can be
unreliable due to network settings and spam filters.
</p>
        <p>For many situations, the HTML testing features provide an acceptable solution to meet a
variety of online testing needs. Review the instructions in this section to learn how to
publish an Internet (HTML) test.</p>
