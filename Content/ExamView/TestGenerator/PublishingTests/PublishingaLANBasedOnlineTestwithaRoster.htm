        <h3 class="task">Publishing a LAN-Based (Online) Test with a Roster</h3>
        <p>Online (LAN) tests may be created with or without a roster. To record the students' results from a test, you probably will want to create a test with a roster. If you are creating a study guide for student use and do not want to record the students' results, you do not need to create a roster.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Create a new test or open an existing test.<p class="InList">An online test can include any of the question types. Many of these question types are automatically scored.</p></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">File</span>, mouse over <span class="Bold">Publish To</span> and select <span class="Bold">ExamView Test Player on LAN</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the radio button labeled <span class="Bold">Allow access to students in a particular class</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Next</span>.</li>
            <li>Review the test summary information. Click Back if necessary to make any changes.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Launch ExamView Test Manager after publishing online test</span> if you want to set up a class roster and other preferences for this test right away. Or, you may choose to manually open ExamView Test Manager and set these options at a later time. Your test will not be available to students until you open Test Manager and set up your preferences.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span> to save the test.<p class="InList">Save the test to a location that is easily accessible to the students. For example, make sure that your students have read/write access to the folder if you store the test on a network server. If you do not have a network, you must copy the online test to each workstation. By default, the test will be saved to the Default Online (LAN) Test Path that is set in the <span class="Italic">Preferences</span>.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you save an online test, the program saves a specially formatted copy of the test (using an EOT extension) to the location you specified. If you saved the test to your hard drive, you will need to copy the EOT file to your network. If your test includes links to any multimedia files, you need to copy those files manually to the same location as the online test.</p>
        <p>Preview your online test to make sure that everything is working. If you notice an error, make any changes to the original test and publish it again.</p>
