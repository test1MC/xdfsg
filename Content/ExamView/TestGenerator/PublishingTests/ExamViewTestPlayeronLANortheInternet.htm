        <h2>ExamView Test Player on LAN or the Internet</h2>
        <p>The ExamView Test Player is a separate program that lets your students take a test at a computer. Depending on the selected options, students can check their own work, receive feedback for incorrect responses and print a detailed report. A LAN-based online test can include the following question types: Multiple Choice, Multiple Response, True/False, Completion (Fill-in-the-Blank), Yes/No, Numeric Response, Essay and Matching. You can also include multimedia clips linked to specific questions (e.g., movies, animations, or audio).</p>
        <div class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f07600;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>Your students must use the latest version or the ExamView Test Player to view online tests created with this version of the ExamView Test Generator.</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you have access to a local area network, it is recommended that you store the online tests on the server. You can install the ExamView Test Player on the server or each individual workstation. If you decide to install the program on individual workstations, run the ExamView Test Player setup at each computer. The setup program should be provided on a separate disk. If you received a CD-ROM, a separate setup program for the player should be located in a sub folder within the ExamView folder.</p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p> <span class="Italic">(PC Only)</span></p>
            <p>To specify the default path where the program looks for tests, set the start-up command as follows—<span class="ComputerText">evplay.exe /testpath=path</span>.</p>
            <p>To turn off the option for students to browse network drives, include <span class="ComputerText">/nobrowse</span> in the start-up command.</p>
