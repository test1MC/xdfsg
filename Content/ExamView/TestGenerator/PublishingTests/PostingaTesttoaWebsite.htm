        <h3 class="task">Posting a Test to a Website</h3>
        <p>Posting to a server can be a complex process. The specific steps will vary depending on the hardware and software configuration of your server. If you are not familiar with the required steps, contact your network administrator for assistance.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Open an<span class="Bold"> FTP program or other utility</span> that allows you to copy files from your hard drive to an internet/intranet server.<p class="InList">After you save a test/study guide formatted for the internet, you must post all of the related files to a location on a server that your students can access. You can post the files to a local area network, intranet server, or an internet server. You must, however, have an active internet connection for students to be able to submit test results. (This is not required for a study guide.)</p></li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Log in</span> to your server.</li>
            <li>Create a <span class="Bold">new folder (if necessary)</span> on your server to hold the test/study guide files.</li>
            <li>Copy the <span class="Bold">HTM file</span> and the <span class="Bold">accompanying folder</span> to a location on your server that your students can access.<p class="InList">When you save an internet test to your hard drive, ExamView Test Generator creates an HTML file and an accompanying folder with all of the necessary image files. This makes it easier for you to post the files to a web server. If, for example, you enter chapter1 for the test file name, the software creates a file called chapter1.htm and a folder called chapter1_files.</p><div class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Gotham Medium';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f07600;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><p>By default, all of the file names are lowercase. Do not change the case since these files are referenced in the HTML document. You must copy the HTML file and the accompanying folder as is. Do not copy the HTML file into the corresponding folder.</p></div></li>
            <li>Log off the server, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Record the URL for the test/study guide HTML document or set up a link to the test.</li>
