        <p>ExamView Test Generator lets you easily create electronic tests that can be taken over the internet with a browser or over a local-area network (LAN) with the ExamView Test Player. To create an online test, create a test using the question selection methods you already know how to use.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="DocType.UG">ExamView tests may be delivered by the following methods:</p>
        <MadCap:miniTocProxy style="mc-toc-depth: 2;" MadCap:conditions="DocType.UG" />
        <p>Online tests may include any or all of the question types, however, only the objective questions (e.g., Multiple Choice, Multiple Response, True/False, Yes/No, Completion, Modified True/False, Matching, and Numeric Response) are automatically graded. You must manually score open-ended questions (e.g., Short Answer, Essay, Case, and Other).</p>
        <p>For internet tests, your students must use a browser such as Internet Explorer 5.0 (or a more recent version) or FireFox 1.0 that supports cascading style sheets level 1 (CSS1) and JavaScript. To post tests or study guides for delivery via the internet, you must have access to the internet.</p>
        <p>Depending on availability, your textbook publisher may offer the capability to publish tests to their website.</p>
