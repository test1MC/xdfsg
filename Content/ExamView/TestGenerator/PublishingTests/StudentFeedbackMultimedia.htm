        <h3>Student Feedback/Multimedia</h3>
        <p>You can set up an internet or LAN-based online test so that students receive feedback for incorrect responses. You can also link multimedia objects (movies, animations, and audio) to the questions for LAN-based tests.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Feedback</p>
        <p>If you want your students to receive feedback when they take a test online, set up the test to allow students to check each response and turn on the option to display feedback. You can record (for example) a learning tip, hint, or reference for each question. Use the <span class="Italic">Add Feedback</span> option from the <span class="Italic">Edit</span> menu to create feedback for true/false, yes/no, multiple choice, and multiple response questions.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Multimedia</p>
        <p>You can set up a multimedia link for many different kinds of multimedia objects. For example, you could link a question to a movie, animation, or audio segment. Simply record the multimedia link by entering the file name along with the other question information. For LAN-based tests, the ExamView Test Player will display a multimedia button when a student accesses the corresponding question.</p>
        <p>If you plan to use multimedia objects, you should copy them to the same folder as the online test. However, your students can access a multimedia object on a CD-ROM or DVD disc.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Hyperlink</p>
        <p>You can insert a hyperlink into any test to be delivered online. The hyperlink can be a link to a movie, audio segment, or another web page.</p>
