        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>Before you begin the writing process, you need to learn how to use the ExamView
Assessment Suite software. While every effort was made to make ExamView
Assessment Suite easy-to-use, your success in authoring questions directly in

information provided in this manual will help you with that process.</p>
