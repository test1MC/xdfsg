        <h1>Using Artwork on Tests</h1>
        <p>Artwork, whether a simple graph or a complex illustration, can enhance any test. Please note that the requirements for each project are different. If you are not sure how to address your specific needs, please contact Turning Technologies before starting your project. If you prefer, you can use placeholders instead of the actual art in the questions (e.g., INSERT FIGURE 1-2 HERE.) and provide the original art to Turning Technologies. Use file names (e.g., figure 01- 2.bmp) for the art so that they correspond to the placeholders in the question banks. Use the following considerations when inserting art into a question or narrative.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">File Formats</p>
        <p>ExamView converts all art to bitmaps (BMP) once inserted into question banks. Bitmaps do not contain compression and will display better inside of ExamView than other formats. Therefore, it is recommended to save all files, whether black and white, color or grayscale, as bitmaps. If using a file format other than bitmap, be aware that the image quality may not be as crisp as the original.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Make sure that each image (text, details, etc.) is legible</p>
        <div class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f07600;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>Images  used in ExamView Test Generator must be legible on paper and on-screen. Check the legibility of the text and other elements to verify that a student can answer the associated question. Art may display differently on different platforms (Mac/PC) and/or operating systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>Art used in a textbook or in a test booklet may appear crisp and clear when printed at 1200 dpi (dots per inch), but be completely unreadable when displayed on a computer screen. For example, a detailed map may include minute details that cannot be seen on a monitor. In this instance,contact your Turning Technologies representative to discuss the best course of action.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Bit Depth</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Saving art as monochrome (or 1-bit) bitmaps produces crisp line art with the smallest file size. It is recommended to convert art to monochrome bitmaps whenever possible. If gray tones or colors are necessary, files can be saved in 4-, 8-, or 24- bit depth. Because of possible conversion problems going from PC to Mac, do not save images in 16-bit depth. Note that the larger the image size, the longer it will take to open the bank files.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Use black and white images whenever possible</p>
        <p>Black &amp; white (1-bit monochrome) images are smaller than images created in any other format. Often, simple illustrations or graphs are saved in a 256-color format even though the only colors in the image are black and white. There may be other times where only a small amount of gray or another color is used but this color is not necessary. Simply reducing the number of colors will dramatically reduce the size of the image. </p>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00a69c;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;">
            <p>If the image does contain only black and white pixels but has been saved in a 256-color format or as a 24-bit image, you can use almost any paint program to reduce the colors to black &amp; white. If you need to change an image that has colors or grays to black &amp; white, you probably need to use a more sophisticated image-processing program (Adobe PhotoShop).</p>
        </div>
        <p>When you create black and white art, it should be created at a larger size and then scaled when you insert it into a question. This results in an image that is higher in resolution for better print output. As a general rule, you should scale black and white images at fifty percent.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="Versions.EV">Never use Metafile 24-bit or 16-bit images</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.EV">Images created in 24-bit or 16-bit mode (a very high resolution resulting in a
large file size) are not appropriate for ExamView® Test Generator. These modes
are required to produce 4-color books, but will cause unnecessary memory
problems and performance issues for programs designed to display on the
screen. Even programs such as Quark® or Photoshop® can take several minutes
just to print or display a large 24-bit image. If you have 16-bit or 24-bit images
inserted into your questions, simply click on the image you want to change. A
border with handles (small squares) appears around the image. Choose Format
Picture from the Format menu. From the Size tab, enable the Lock aspect ratio
check box if you want the program to automatically adjust the image in
proportion to a change in either width or height. Set the scaling or the
width/height to change the size of an image. Set the baseline. From the Picture
tab, you can choose the Picture type that requires the least amount of memory
while retaining the desired picture quality. Use the Crop from feature if you want
to cut any sections off the edges of the picture.</p>
        <div class="ImageANDCaption">
            <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Never use enhanced metafiles</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Enhanced metafiles DO NOT display on Mac computers. These images can be converted to 24-bit or 256 bitmap and will display on both Mac and PC computers. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="Versions.EV">Never scale a color or grayscale (16-color or 256-color) image</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.EV">You should not scale color images in ExamView® Test Generator. Doing so will
blur the image on screen. If there is text in the image, it may make the text
unreadable. Note: Any scaling should be done in a program such as Photoshop®
before inserting the image into ExamView® Test Generator.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Scale and Dimensions</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Only monochrome bitmaps can be scaled down after insertion into ExamView PC Banks without possible loss of image quality. Because scaling improves the image clarity, it is recommended to         save monochrome bitmaps at 200% to 400% of the final size at 96 dpi. </p>
        <div class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #31b24a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ">
            <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">If the final test is  to be printed and you want the art to be 3 inches wide, save the monochrome art between 576 and  1152 pixels wide and scale to the proper size. </p>
        </div>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Scaling grayscale or color images saved in 4-, 8-, or 24-bit depth can cause scan lines to drop out on PC displays, risking the loss of critical information.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">For PC banks, save grayscale and color images at 100% of final size at 96 dpi, not to exceed 528 pixels wide.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Color images must not exceed 5.5” (width) by 6” (height).</p>
        <p>The displayed dimensions of black and white or color images should not exceed the entry area size provided in ExamView Test Generator. </p>
        <div class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #31b24a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ">
            <p>A screen capture from a program may be up to 10” wide. To reduce the physical size, crop the image to show only the necessary parts, or scale it (in PhotoShop) if, by scaling it, the image retains all of the relevant details.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Because instructors can use the two column test format, consider sizing art no larger than 2.75” (width) by 3” (height). This size will allow art to be formatted into two columns.</p>
        <p>Artwork that needs to remain large for readability (maps, graphs, etc.) may still be used with the two column format feature. In such instances, the art will remain full size and the formatting for questions attached to that piece of art will revert to one column.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Mac vs. PC Resolution</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Display resolutions vary; PC is typically 96 dpi while Mac is 72 dpi. This means images created for PC question banks will be automatically scaled down when converted to Mac. </p>
        <div class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #31b24a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ">
            <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">If a monochrome bitmap was scaled at 50% in PC, it will be scaled at 33% on Mac. 4-, 8-, or 24-bit images inserted into Mac question banks should be scaled at 75%, so that they will be automatically scaled at 100% when they are converted to PC.</p>
        </div>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">While it is important never to scale 4-, 8-, or 24-bit images inside of PC banks, images in Mac question banks can be scaled without affecting quality.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">Section 508 Compliance of the Rehabilitation Act</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Versions.Word">It is necessary to use consistent guidelines for the alternate text to be readable by most screen readers.
