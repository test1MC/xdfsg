        <h2 class="task">Narratives</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="">A narrative is a table, descriptive passage, special instruction, picture or other
information that can be attached to (or linked to) one or more questions. All
questions linked to the same narrative print together as a group on a test, but the
instructor is not required to select all of the questions.</p>
        <p>You can attach a narrative to any question type except matching. Matching
questions cannot be linked to a narrative because the choices already act as a
narrative. For figures and tables, label the information and refer to it by that label in
a question. See the examples below.</p>
        <div class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Montserrat';&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatFamily&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #31b24a;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;EXAMPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ">

For example, include a label such as
Figure 3-2. Then, include the label as part of the question (e.g., As shown in Figure 3-

You must
use unique names across the entire project. For example, you can not have a Figure 1 in
Chapter 1 and a Figure 1 in Chapter 2. Make the names <span class="Italic">Figure 1-1</span> and <span class="Italic">Figure 2-1</span>. An
exception to this rule is when the same exact narrative is used in multiple banks. In
this case, use the same narrative name.
</p><p>You can include part of the ISBN number with the narrative name (e.g., Figure 1-1
0144-01, Figure 1-2 0144-01) to differentiate among narratives across multiple
textbooks.</p></div></li><li>Click <span class="Bold">Record</span> to save the narrative. </li><li>Click <span class="Bold">Done</span> when are you finished with the narrative.</li></ol></li>

                <p>As you are entering or editing the questions, a pop-up menu appears at the
bottom of the entry window for all question types except matching. Select the narrative
from the list to attach it to the question. When you record the question, the
narrative will automatically appear above the question.</p>
