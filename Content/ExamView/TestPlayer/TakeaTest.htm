        <h1>Take a Test with the Test Player</h1>
        <p>For tests that you administer on your local area network (LAN), students must use the
ExamView Test Player to take the test. Before your students can take the test, make
sure that the program is installed on your network and that students have read/write (full)
access to the folder where the test is located.
</p>
        <p>You can include any question type (multiple choice, true/false, numeric response,
completion, essay, etc.) on an online test. The program automatically scores any
objective (e.g., multiple choice, completion, or numeric response questions.) You must
manually score any open-ended (e.g., essay) questions.</p>
