        <h2>Whiteboard Mode</h2>
        <p>When Whiteboard Mode is selected, all notes made on the whiteboard can be captured and saved as pages within WorkSpace for distribution, without the use of the projector.</p>
        <p>The communication in Whiteboard Mode is one-way between the DualBoard and the computer. A projector is not involved and computer input is not communicated back to the Dualboard. A special dry erasable pen is needed.</p>
