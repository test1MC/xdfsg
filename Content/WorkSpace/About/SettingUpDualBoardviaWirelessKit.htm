        <h3 class="task">Setting Up the DualBoard via Wireless Kit</h3>
        <p>The Turning Technologies Device Manager must be installed on your computer prior to using the DualBoard. Device Manager is automatically installed with the following software: WorkSpace, CPS, Response and Flow.</p>
        <p>An RF (Radio Frequency) receiver plugs into a USB port on your computer or a powered USB Hub. A second receiver is connected to the DualBoard controller box via USB cable. The receiver is seated in a holster that slips over the frame at the top of the board.</p>
        <p>The RF receiver works best when it is not plugged into a computer that is under a podium or a desk. If necessary, use a powered USB extension cable to remove the RF receiver from under furniture that may shield the RF signal.</p>
