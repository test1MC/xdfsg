        <p class="SmallTitle">User Selectable Folders</p>
        <p>When WorkSpace is installed, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">four</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="OS.Mac">six</MadCap:conditionalText> <span class="Bold">User Selectable Folders</span> are created in the Documents\InterWrite WorkSpace folder. These folders provide default locations for GWB image files, exported presentation files, images for the Gallery, graphics to use with the Stamper tool and AVI files.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Images stored in the <span class="Italic">User Pictures Folder</span> can be accessed in My Gallery, which is opened from the Gallery Menu. Images can also be used by the Create Image Page tool as Image Page backgrounds, or inserted on a page in the Annotation Window using the Insert Media tool. </li>
            <li>User-supplied stamps will be displayed in the Properties Bar for the Stamper tool. Both images and stamps must be in BMP, GIF, JPEG, TIFF or PNG format.</li>
            <li>The Record and Playback tool will play any AVI<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="OS.PC"> or WMV</MadCap:conditionalText> recording stored in the <span class="Italic">User Recordings Folder</span> by opening the default video player on the system.</li>
            <li>To change the location of a folder, select the folder in the User Selectable Folders list, click Browse and navigate to a new location.</li>

        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Annotation Window Options</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">By default, the <span class="Italic">Allow Window Sizing</span> checkbox is selected.

        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Cursor Orientation</p>

        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Default Internet Address</p>

        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Automatically Save Pages</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Presentation files are automatically saved as they are created. By default, the <span class="Bold">Auto Save</span> option is set to save every five (5) minutes. Auto Save can be disabled, or the frequency can be changed, by selecting a different time interval.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Add Page Title</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">By default, the title that appears on the <span class="Italic">Annotation</span> window title bar is automatically added to the pages of exported and printed presentation files. These options can be turned off by clearing the respective checkboxes.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Curve Smoothing</p>

        <p class="SmallTitle" MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Snap Grid Settings</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="OS.PC">Selecting this checkbox forces drawn objects to be drawn at a set grid point. You also can choose to display the grid on-screen and determine the grid spacing.</p>
