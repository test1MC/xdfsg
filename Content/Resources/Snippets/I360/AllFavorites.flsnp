        <p>All favorites, classes, student data and other Insight 360 information resides on the computer used to set up this data. This data is not accessible if you take the Mobi 360 or the Insight 360 Teacher app to another classroom, even if that classroom computer is running Insight 360. You must also set up that computer with the same classes, students, favorites and other data.</p>
