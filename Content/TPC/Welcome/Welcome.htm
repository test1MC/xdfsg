        <p>TurningPoint Cloud combines seamless polling with PowerPoint® (<span class="Italic">PowerPoint Polling</span>), over top of any application (<span class="Italic">Anywhere Polling</span>), and self-paced tests, evaluations and surveys (<span class="Italic">Self-Paced Polling</span>). Conduct real-time assessments to track progress (<span class="Italic">Results Manager</span>) and instantly view results and collect valuable data all from one easy-to-use application.</p>
        <p>TurningPoint Cloud provides cloud management of users and participant lists while effortlessly integrating with other organization-adopted solutions to accelerate learner success. Currently, cloud management is computer-specific, however development is rapidly expanding to build parity and syncing between the desktop and the cloud.</p>
        <p>Both instructors and participants are required to have a Turning Account, which provides a unique identifier for each user that is tied to all software accounts and response devices. In addition to the Turning Account, participants are required to have a Turning Account license and may also be required to have a ResponseWare Presentation license.</p>
