        <h1>Triton Data Collection System and CIITS</h1>
        <p>This document outlines the steps for using the Triton Data Collection System with CIITS.</p>
        <div class="TDCSImportant">
            <p>Triton Data Collection System is only compatible with CIITS versions <br />14.1 or higher.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="SmallTitle">How does the integration work?</p>
        <p>The student/participant information is downloaded from CIITS and then copied and pasted into the Triton Participant Upload Template. A Blueprint is scheduled and administered via the Triton Proctor Application and the results are automatically uploaded into Triton Web. The student ID and student responses are then exported from Triton Web as a CSV for upload into CIITS.</p>
