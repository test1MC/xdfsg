        <h3>Response Connections</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Users.Level1">By default the receiver and ResponseCards are set to Channel 41. If you are the only TurningPoint user within a 200ft radius on Channel 41, simply plug in the receiver and begin polling. If another user is on Channel 41, you must use a different channel to avoid interference. ResponseCards must be set to the same channel as the receiver.</p>
