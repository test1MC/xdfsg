        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Results Manager Overview screen displays all of the sessions associated with a participant list. The top right of the screen displays the participant list name, number of columns, number of participants, maximum points and average score.</p>
        <p>Participant names (last name, first name) are displayed in the first column. The User ID is displayed if the participant list does not contain first and last names. The Device ID is displayed if the participant list does not contain names or User IDs.</p>
        <p>Columns with a white background represent individual sessions or manual columns. Columns with a shaded background are compiled by TurningPoint and can be hidden. Session columns are arranged by the order in which they were added to the TurningPoint Sessions folder. The sessions are arranged alphabetically if several sessions are added to the Sessions folder at once. In Results Manager, columns may be manually reordered, if necessary.</p>
        <p>The Overview panel on the right changes depending on the area selected in the Results Manager Overview. Each category can be expanded to reveal additional options.</p>
        <p>TurningPoint automatically saves any changes made within Results Manager.</p>
