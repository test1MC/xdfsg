        <h1>Welcome to TurningPoint 5!</h1>
        <p>TurningPoint combines all of the Turning Technologies legacy applications into one, user-friendly interface. Content creation, participant lists, data management <span class="Italic">(Results Manager)</span> and reports are in one central location. All three polling environments: PowerPoint Polling (<span class="Italic">formerly TurningPoint</span>), Anywhere Polling <span class="Italic">(formerly TurningPoint Anywhere)</span> and Self-Paced Polling <span class="Italic">(formerly TurningKey)</span> are included.</p>
        <p>Existing content such as question lists, participant lists and session files can be imported directly into the new software.</p>
