        <h1>Network Firewall and Content Filter</h1>
        <p>Insight 360 Cloud periodically checks for updates, and must be connected to the internet to do so. This is one of the reasons that having internet access is required, along with other features of the software, such as reporting. The updating process also checks for firmware updates for any connected eInstruction 360 devices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is important that the instructor does not disconnect or turn off devices during the update process. </li>
            <li>Instructors must have the correct privileges to install software updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="SmallTitle">How to update Insight 360 Cloud...</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>If an update is available, a notification is displayed on the Insight 360 Cloud Home page. Click <span class="Bold">About</span> to take note of the current version number as you will need this to confirm that the update was successful.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="Bold">update notification</span> in the <span class="Italic">Message Center</span> on the Home page.</li>
            <li>An update screen appears and the software restarts to complete the update.</li>
            <li>After the update is complete, click <span class="Bold">About</span> to ensure that the new version number is displayed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="SmallTitle" style="margin-top: 24pt;">Network Firewall </p>
        <p>The firewall must allow communication between your computer and the Insight 360 Cloud update servers, which are located online. You must have access to: <a href="http://insight360services.einstruction.com/StarfishCloudServices">http://insight360services.einstruction.com/StarfishCloudServices</a>.</p>
        <p>If you experience any of the following problems, it is most likely due to your network firewall blocking communication to the above URL:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>District list not populating when registering the software.</li>
            <li>Error messages when registering.</li>
            <li>Error messages when updating firmware or software.</li>
        </ul>
