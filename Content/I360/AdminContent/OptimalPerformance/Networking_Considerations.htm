        <h2>Networking Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that your network has enough bandwidth to handle your current data traffic plus the added data traffic from your Insight 360 Cloud software, especially during peak load times. Please work with your network administrator or vendor for help.</li>
            <li>It is recommended to have the instructor’s computer, iPad and student iPad applications running on the same VLAN. Since this is not always possible and student and instructor VLANs are created to keep them separated for security purposes, try to limit the amount of hops between the student and instructor installations as well as between the instructor iPad and the instructor’s computer running the Insight 360 Cloud application. Additionally, if the student and instructor installations are on different VLANs, it is important to ensure that the necessary ports are opened between VLANs.<p><span class="Bold">VLAN Navigation</span></p><p>Many districts have chosen to use virtual local area networks (VLAN) to segregate network traffic in an effort to increase quality of service and security. Insight 360 Cloud can navigate these configurations with the use of port forwarding policies on firewalls and Ethernet switches. Below is a list of the ports and associated protocols in use with Insight 360 Cloud.</p><table style="width: 599px;caption-side: top;mc-table-style: url('../../../Resources/TableStyles/AlternateShading.css');" class="TableStyle-AlternateShading" cellspacing="0"><col width="133px" class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Column-Column1" /><col width="133px" class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Column-Column1" /><col width="333px" class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Column-Column1" /><thead><tr class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Head-Header1"><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-HeadE-Column1-Header1"><p>Port</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-HeadE-Column1-Header1"><p>Protocol</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-HeadD-Column1-Header1"><p>Function</p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>31009</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>UDP</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyD-Column1-Body1"><p>Multicasting for connection facilitation</p></td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>65007</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>TCP</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyD-Column1-Body1"><p>Data for Teacher app</p></td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>65008</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><p>TCP</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyD-Column1-Body1"><p>Data for Student app</p></td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyB-Column1-Body1"><p>64250</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyB-Column1-Body1"><p>HTTP</p></td><td class="TableStyle-AlternateShading-BodyA-Column1-Body1"><p>API access for partner integrations</p></td></tr></tbody></table></li>
            <li>If separate VLANs as well as Intrusion Detection Services (IDS) or Intrusion Protection Services (IPS) are in use between VLANs, there is a possibility that some latency could be added to a student or teacher’s experience. This is because the packets sent between systems are broken down by IDS/IPS and inspected for malicious intent. If you experience latency with IDS/IPS in between VLANs, consider making an exception for these applications. Please work with your IDS/IPS equipment vendor to determine how to do this.</li>
            <li>Make sure that all network ports in use for Insight 360 Cloud are using optimal settings by checking that they are using full duplex and the largest bandwidth setting supported by your network. Ports on your networking equipment that are left to “auto negotiate” will sometime default to lesser settings when there are incompatibilities between networking equipment. This means that manual settings are needed to correct this behavior.</li>
