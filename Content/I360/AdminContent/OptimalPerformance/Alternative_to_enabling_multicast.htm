        <h3>Alternative to enabling Multicast</h3>
        <p>The Insight 360 Teacher app can work without using Multicast on your network. In this case, the students must manually enter the IP address of the desktop computer in which the Insight 360 Cloud software is installed. The iPad will remember this address, but as with most networks using dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), it may require the user to re-enter it occasionally to connect to the class if the IP address on the instructor’s computer ever changes.</p>
