        <h2>Anti Virus</h2>
        <p>While anti-virus software is a necessity, it also has the propensity to slow computers down and cause interference with the performance of Insight 360 Cloud, especially on older machines. Additionally, anti-virus software has been known to interfere with the detection of HID devices and may include firewalls that block ports necessary for Insight 360 Cloud. If you are experiencing performance issues or issues connecting your devices to a computer running Insight 360 Cloud, you can rule out anti-virus as the cause by temporarily disabling the anti-virus software. If this resolves the issue, then you should work with your anti-virus vendor to make the necessary changes to your anti-virus software to resolve these issues.</p>
