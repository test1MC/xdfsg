        <h2>Quality of Service (QOS)</h2>
        <p>QOS is the ability to provide different priorities to different applications, users, or network data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow over your network. See page 11 for VLAN Navigation. </p>
        <p>If you experience latency with your Insight 360 Cloud application, it could be the result of network saturation during peak load times. Therefore, it may be necessary to implement QOS on your network to ensure that your Insight 360 Cloud application network traffic is prioritized and receives the necessary amount of bandwidth to provide an optimal experience. Please refer to your networking equipment documentation and/or your networking vendor for help implementing QOS on your network.</p>
