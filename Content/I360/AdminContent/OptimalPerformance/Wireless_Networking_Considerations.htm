        <h2>Wireless Networking Considerations</h2>
        <p>Since the Insight 360 Teacher and Student apps rely heavily on your wireless infrastructure, the following factors play an important role in ensuring an optimal experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that your wireless access points are capable of handling the bandwidth requirements for your current data traffic plus the added data traffic from your Insight 360 Cloud software, especially during peak load times.</li>
            <li>Most wireless access point vendors will provide tools that provide a view into your wireless access point’s bandwidth utilization. Please refer to your wireless vendor’s documentation for help, and work with your network administrator or vendor. Please note that while your wired network may provide 1GB of bandwidth, most wireless access points can only provide a fraction of this bandwidth and could become overwhelmed even if your wired network is nowhere near saturation.</li>
            <li>The bandwidth available to a wireless device is directly proportional to the wireless signal strength the device receives. Therefore, it is important to ensure that wireless access points are laid out in an optimal fashion to ensure that each device in use has the best signal possible.</li>
        </ul>
