        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <p>There are four ways to install the Insight 360 Cloud software:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;letter-spacing: 0em;color: #514f51;text-decoration: none;">Install the software using the disk </li>
            <li>Download the software from einstruction.com</li>
            <li>Silent (or Network) Installation </li>
            <li>Imaging/ghosting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions for each type of installation are described on the following pages. </p>
        <p>Some important information about installing and using Insight 360 Cloud:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Once Insight 360 Cloud is installed, it is important that the instructors, not the IT Admin, register and activate the software. See page 16 for more information on registering and activating.</li>
            <li>Insight 360 Cloud automatically loads on startup. It also ‘listens’ for eInstruction devices that can be used with Insight 360 Cloud, so they will be detected when they are connected to the computer. This process can be terminated by pressing Crtl+Shift+Q on both PC and Mac.</li>
            <li>Insight 360 Cloud supports annotation on the main/primary display. If you are using multiple monitors or displays, such as a projector, make sure the display you want to show annotations is set as the main/primary monitor. You can also setup a secondary monitor, such as projector, to mirror the main/primary display.</li>
