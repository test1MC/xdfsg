        <p>The Response Distribution Chart displays the number of student responses for each answer choice in the most recent question and is compatible with all supported question types. The chart provides a summary of student responses for an individual question and can be displayed on the classroom computer desktop. </p>
        <p>The Student Performance Table lists question responses by student name and is compatible with all supported question types. Icons indicate whether each answer is correct or incorrect. A series of dashes indicates that a connected student has not yet responded to the question. </p>
