        <p>You can use Insight 360 Cloud to associate individual Answer Key and CueTag questions with US educational standards. Answer Key and ExamView tests can contain questions associated with both Common Core and US state standards. Individual questions tagged with CueTag barcodes can also be associated with Common Core and US state standards. Selected standards populate a "quick select" list available for future questions. You can generate Standards Analysis and Multiple Analysis reports at the class and student levels to view student proficiency.</p>
        <p>Insight 360 Cloud uses Common Core and US educational standards from <a href="http://www.academicbenchmarks.org/" target="_blank">Academic Benchmarks</a>. Academic Benchmarks collects and maintains content, assessment and performance standards used by many education professionals in the United States. Common Core standards are available for K-12 English Language Arts and K-12 Mathematics.</p>
        <p>Common Core standards are automatically installed when you install Insight 360 Cloud. If you include a US state when you register your copy of the Insight 360 Cloud software, the standards for that state will install when you activate the Insight 360 Cloud software.</p>
