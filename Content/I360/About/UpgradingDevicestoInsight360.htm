        <h3 class="task">Upgrading Devices to Insight 360 Cloud</h3>
        <p>In many cases, you can use previous generations of devices with the Insight 360 Cloud system.</p>
        <div class="Important">
            <p>Mac users must contact Technical Support before upgrading MobiView™, Pulse or Spark devices.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A MobiView mobile interactive whiteboard and its corresponding receiver can be upgraded to become a Mobi 360 mobile interactive whiteboard with “Teach Class” capability and Mobi 360 receiver.</p>
        <p>	Pulse and Spark clickers and their corresponding receivers can be upgraded to become Pulse 360 and Spark 360 participant devices with receivers.</p>
        <p>	For all devices listed above, this is a one-way upgrade initiated from <span class="Bold">My Settings</span> <img src="../../Graphics/I360/Icon-MySettings.png" class="Inline30px" /> in the Insight 360 Cloud software.</p>
        <div class="Warning">
            <p>Once a device is upgraded, it cannot be used in its original configuration again. For example, a MobiView that has been upgraded to a Mobi 360 cannot be used with the WorkSpace™ or CPS™ student response systems.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Mobi KWIK™ and Mobi Learner™ mobile interactive whiteboards can be used with Insight 360 Cloud following a firmware update as learner devices in multi-user mode. These devices do not need to be upgraded and can continue to function with CPS, Response™ and WorkSpace through Device Manager.</p>
        <ol class="Gotham">
            <li>Insert the Mobi RF receiver into an available USB port on the computer with the Insight 360 Cloud software.</li>
            <li>Use a USB cable to connect the MobiView to the same computer as in step 1.</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Graphics/I360/Icon-MySettings.png" class="Inline30px" title="My Settings" alt="My Settings" /> in Insight 360 Cloud.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="Bold">Upgrade Devices to Insight 360 Cloud</span> from the left menu.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Upgrade your MobiView and Mobi RF receiver to Insight 360 Cloud </span>radio button.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Start Upgrade</span>. <p class="InList">A dialog box notifies you that the upgrade cannot be undone.</p></li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">OK</span> to upgrade your devices.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="Bold">Start Upgrade</span>. <p>Progress bars display the status of the upgrade.</p><div class="Warning"><p>Do NOT disconnect the MobiView or Mobi RF receiver while the upgrade is in process.</p><p>If you are attempting to upgrade using a Mac, a message will appear. Please contact Technical Support to assist you before continuing.</p></div></li>
            <li>When the upgrade is complete, click <span class="Bold">Finish</span>.<p>The MobiView is now upgraded to a Mobi 360, and the Mobi RF receiver is now upgraded to a Mobi 360 receiver. You can now disconnect the Mobi 360 from the computer.</p></li>
