        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>To view your licensing information click <img src="../../Graphics/I360/Icon-MySettings.png" class="Inline30px" title="My Settings" alt="My Settings" /> and select <span class="Bold">About</span>, or click <span class="Bold">About</span> from anywhere in Insight 360 Cloud.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Insight 360 Cloud Standard</p>
        <p>The Insight 360 Cloud Standard Edition gives educators mobile desktop control on their tablets with the Insight 360 Teacher app or the Mobi 360. Teachers can facilitate lessons and access instant data sent from a variety of participant devices from anywhere in the room. Students can use Pulse 360 and ResponseCard NXT clickers, as well as the QT Device,  to respond to questions during class. One of the many features Standard licensing provides is CueTag™. A CueTag is a simple tag that can be pasted on almost any digital material and turns the content into formative assessment. A CueTag makes existing digital content compatible with Insight 360 Cloud, allowing an instructor to poll the content and collect real-time data during formative instruction. The lesson is never interrupted for assessment. CueTag contains information about the assessment item including question name, type, correct answer and state or Common Core Standards.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Insight 360 Cloud Mobile Edition</p>
        <p>The Insight 360 Cloud Mobile Edition includes all of the features the Standard Edition offers educators plus increased participant interaction with the Insight 360 Student app.</p>
        <p class="SmallTitle">Insight 360 Cloud Web Access</p>
        <p>Combine either the Insight 360 Cloud Standard Edition or the Insight 360 Cloud Mobile Edition with the Insight 360 Cloud Web Access add-on and turn smartphones, the iPad®, Android™ tablets, laptops or desktop computers into response devices. Web Access also works with Mobi 360, the Insight 360 Teacher app and all Insight 360 Cloud compatible clickers.</p>
