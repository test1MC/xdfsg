                <p>If the Insight 360 Cloud software does not open, check the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Double-click the Insight 360 Cloud icon on the classroom computer desktop.</li>
                    <li>Is another instance of Insight 360 Cloud already open, but hidden behind other windows on your computer?</li>
                    <li>If there is no icon on the desktop, was the software installed correctly or were there any errors? Contact your IT Administrator if you experienced errors during installation.</li>
                    <li>Did you have Admin (administrative) rights on your computer when you installed Insight 360 Cloud? Contact your IT Administrator if you are unsure.</li>
                    <li>Is Insight 360 Cloud listed as an installed program on your Start menu (Windows) or in your Applications folder (Mac)?</li>
                    <li>Does your computer have an anti-virus or firewall software that would prevent you from installing new software? Be sure you disabled any anti-virus software on your system before installing Insight 360 Cloud.

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If your Mobi 360 digital pen does not work, check the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The red protective tape has been completely removed from the battery section of the digital pen. The thin plastic tape keeps the battery from discharging during storage and shipment. It must be completely removed upon hardware set up. Occasionally a small piece of tape remains behind. To determine whether any tape is stuck between the pen sections, gently press the tab on the back of the pen, slide the two sections apart, and check around the battery for remnants of red tape.</li>
                    <li>The digital pen proximity indicator shows on the Mobi 360 when the pen tip nears the Mobi 360 writing surface. If this indicator is red, the digital pen needs recharging. Place the digital pen in the Mobi 360 holder, ensuring it clicks into place. The pen icon on the Mobi 360 shows charging when the pen is correctly situated. You can use the Mobi 360 while charging the pen, but should place the Mobi 360 on its charging stand when it is not in use to charge both the Mobi 360 and its digital pen. The digital pen requires eight hours to fully charge a drained battery.</li>
                    <li>If the digital pen proximity indicator does not show at all, the pen battery may need to be replaced.</li>

                <p>There are two ways to send feedback to clickers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To always send feedback at the end of Verbal, Tagged, or ExamView questions, select the <span class="Bold">Send correct/incorrect feedback to student devices at the end of each question</span> checkbox in Preferences.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>If these options are selected and clickers do not show feedback during these occasions, check the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure the Pulse/Spark 360 receiver is plugged into a USB port on the computer running the Insight 360 Cloud software.</li>
